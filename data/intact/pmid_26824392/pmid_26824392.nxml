    Phosphoproteomics reveals that Parkinson's disease kinase LRRK2 regulates a subset of Rab GTPases
   </article-title>

    <p>
     Mutations in Park8, encoding for the multidomain Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein, comprise the predominant genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). G2019S, the most common amino acid substitution activates the kinase two- to threefold. This has motivated the development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors; however, poor consensus on physiological LRRK2 substrates has hampered clinical development of such therapeutics. We employ a combination of phosphoproteomics, genetics, and pharmacology to unambiguously identify a subset of Rab GTPases as key LRRK2 substrates. LRRK2 directly phosphorylates these both in vivo and in vitro on an evolutionary conserved residue in the switch II domain. Pathogenic LRRK2 variants mapping to different functional domains increase phosphorylation of Rabs and this strongly decreases their affinity to regulatory proteins including Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Our findings uncover a key class of bona-fide LRRK2 substrates and a novel regulatory mechanism of Rabs that connects them to PD.

     Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the nervous system that affects approximately 1% of the elderly population. Mutations in the gene that encodes an enzyme known as LRRK2 are the most common causes of the inherited form of the disease. Such mutations generally increase the activity of LRRK2 and so drug companies have developed drugs that inhibit LRRK2 to prevent or delay the progression of Parkinson’s disease. However, it was not known what role LRRK2 plays in cells, and why its over-activation is harmful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Steger et al. used a 'proteomics' approach to find other proteins that are regulated by LRRK2. The experiments tested a set of newly developed LRRK2 inhibitors in cells and brain tissue from mice. The mice had mutations in the gene encoding LRRK2 that are often found in human patients with Parkinson’s disease. The experiments show that LRRK2 targets some proteins belonging to the Rab GTPase family, which are involved in transporting molecules and other 'cargoes' around cells. Several Rab GTPases are less active in the mutant mice, which interferes with the ability of these proteins to correctly direct the movement of cargo around the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Steger et al.’s findings will help to advance the development of new therapies for Parkinson’s disease. The next challenges are to identify how altering the activity of Rab GTPases leads to degeneration of the nervous system and how LRRK2 inhibitors may slow down these processes.

    Introduction
   </title>
   <p>
    Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting 1–2% of the elderly population (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Lees et al., 2009
    </xref>
    ). Environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease, but its precise etiology still remains elusive (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Burbulla and Krüger, 2011
    </xref>
    ). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have related 28 genetic risk variants at 24 loci with nonfamilial PD (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Nalls et al., 2014
    </xref>
    ). Among those, mutations in LRRK2 (Park8) are also found in hereditary forms, pinpointing a shared molecular pathway driving pathogenesis in both familial and non-familial PD and comprising the most common cause of the disease (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Simón-Sánchez et al., 2009
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Satake et al., 2009
    </xref>
    ). LRRK2 encodes a large protein composed of central kinase and GTPase (ROC-COR) domains that are surrounded by multiple protein-protein interaction regions. PD pathogenic LRRK2 mutations map predominantly to the kinase (G2019S, I2020T) and the ROC-COR domains (R1441C/G/H, Y1699C), implying that these enzymatic activities are crucial for pathogenesis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Rudenko and Cookson, 2014
    </xref>
    ). Presently, it is unclear how LRRK2 mutations occurring in different functional domains all predispose to PD. The most common PD-associated LRRK2 mutation is the G2019S amino acid substitution, which activates the kinase two- to threefold (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     West et al., 2005
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">

    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Jaleel et al., 2007
    </xref>
    ). Since protein kinases are attractive pharmacological targets, this finding has raised hopes that selective LRRK2 inhibition can prevent or delay the onset of PD (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Yao et al., 2013
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Extensive studies of LRRK2 have associated it with diverse cellular processes such as Wnt signaling, mitochondrial disease, cytoskeleton remodeling, vesicular trafficking, autophagy, and protein translation (

    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Papkovskaia et al., 2012
    </xref>
    ). Moreover, several LRRK2 substrates have been reported previously; however, evidence that they are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in a physiological context is generally lacking and proofs are confined to in vitro approaches or to cellular systems using overexpressed kinase (

    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Schapansky et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). Overall, there is little consensus on the cellular roles of LRRK2; thus, identification of definitive and verifiable physiological LRRK2 substrates is considered to be one of the greatest challenges in the field (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Schapansky et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides mutations in LRRK2, other genetic risk variants for PD map to the Park16 locus. Among the five genes within this locus is Rab7L1 (also known as Rab29), which together with LRRK2 increases nonfamilial PD risk. Depletion of Rab7L1 recapitulates the dopaminergic neuron loss observed with LRRK2-G2019S expression and its overexpression rescues mutant LRRK2 phenotypes (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     MacLeod et al., 2013
    </xref>
    ). Rab GTPases comprise ~70 family members in humans, and they are key players in all forms of intracellular vesicular trafficking events (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Stenmark, 2009
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Rivero-Ríos et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). Apart from Rab7L1, several other family members have been associated with PD pathogenesis. For example, mutations in Rab39b (Park21 locus) predispose to PD in humans (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Wilson et al., 2014
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Mata et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). Moreover, overexpression of Rab8a, Rab1, and Rab3a attenuate α-synclein-induced cytotoxicity in cellular and animal models of PD, suggesting a functional interplay between Rab GTPases and known PD factors (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Cooper, 2006
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Gitler et al., 2008
    </xref>
    ). Recently, another PD-connected protein kinase termed PTEN-Induce Kinase-1 (PINK1) has been reported to indirectly control the phosphorylation of a small group of Rabs including Rab8a at Ser111 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Lai et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). Despite these intriguing links, it is presently unclear whether LRRK2 directly or indirectly modulates Rab GTPases at the molecular level and if so, by which mechanism.
   </p>
   <p>
    High-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) has become the method of choice for confident identification of in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation events (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Roux and Thibault, 2013
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Lemeer and Heck, 2009
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Olsen et al., 2006
    </xref>
    ). With current MS instrumentation, proteomics can identify tens of thousands of phosphosites (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Sharma et al., 2014
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Mallick and Kuster, 2010
    </xref>
    ). However, challenges in the phosphoproteomic approaches are to determine functionally relevant residues from these large datasets and to establish direct kinase-substrate relationships.
   </p>
   <p>
    As such, we complement the power of modern phosphoproteomics with parallel genetic, biochemical and pharmacological approaches to establish direct, in vivo LRRK2 substrates. Using fibroblasts derived from two different LRRK2 knock-in mouse lines we identify a subset of Rab GTPases as bona-fide LRRK2 targets. LRRK2 phosphorylates these substrates on an evolutionarily conserved residue situated in their switch II domain both in human and murine cells and in mouse brain. The phosphorylation of Rabs by LRRK2 is direct and strikingly all LRRK2 missense mutations that contribute to PD pathogenesis increase the phosphorylation of at least three Rab GTPases. Further, we establish that different PD pathogenic mutations modulate the interaction with a number of regulatory proteins including guanine dissociation inhibitors (GDI1/2). In this way, LRRK2 regulates the specific insertion of Rab GTPases into target membranes thereby altering their membrane-cytosol equilibrium.

     Identification of LRRK2 substrates in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
    </title>
    <p>
     To search for bona-fide physiological LRRK2 substrates, we performed a dual-phosphoproteomic screening approach using knock-in lines harboring either hyperactive LRRK2 or a LRRK2 variant with wild-type activity but insensitive to a highly selective, newly developed LRRK2 compound. For our first screen (PS1), we generated a mouse model harboring the LRRK2-G2019S substitution that increases kinase activity two- to threefold (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1B
     </xref>
     ). We derived fibroblasts from these animals and treated them with two structurally different LRRK2 inhibitors, GSK2578215A (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Reith et al., 2012
     </xref>
     ) or HG-10-102-01 (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Choi et al., 2012

     ) (

     </xref>
     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 1A
     </xref>
     ). This screening modality offers three major advantages; first, increased activity of the G2019S-LRRK2 kinase amplifies the chance of finding bona-fide substrates, second, using an isogenic system excludes that measured phosphoproteome changes are due to differences in the genetic background and third, considering only the overlapping population of significantly modulated phosphopeptides of two structurally distinct inhibitors constitutes a very stringent criterion for specifically pinpointing LRRK2 substrates.

     The second screen (PS2) added another layer of specificity by combining phosphoproteomics with genetics and chemical biology. For this, we used fibroblasts derived from either wt or A2016T-LRRK2 knock-in mice and treated them with the newly developed, highly potent and selective LRRK2 compound MLI-2 (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Fell et al., 2015
     </xref>
     ) The A2016T substitution does not change basal LRRK2 activity but decreases sensitivity to MLI-2 ~10-fold (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1C,D
     </xref>
     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 1B
     </xref>
     ). At a dose of 10 nM, we observed a substantial decrease in phosphorylation of LRRK2-pS935, which is associated with LRRK2 kinase activity (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Dzamko et al., 2010
     </xref>
     ), in wt but not in A2016T cells (
     <xref ref-type="fig">

     </xref>
     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 1C
     </xref>
     ). Under these conditions, the phosphoproteome of wt MEFs includes both LRRK2-specific and off-target sites, whereas A2016T (which is resistant to MLI-2) only includes off-targets. Therefore, direct quantitative comparison should reveal true LRRK2 substrates (

     ).

     Using a state-of-the-art workflow for phosphopeptide enrichment, label-free LC-MS/MS and the MaxQuant environment for stringent statistical data evaluation (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">

     </xref>
     ;
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Cox et al., 2011
     </xref>
     ), we quantified over 9000 high-confidence phosphosites in each replicate in both screens (median R=0.80 and 0.89 in PS1 and PS2, respectively), (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G
     </xref>
     and
     <a>
      Supplementary file 1
     </a>
     ). Independently acquired proteome measurements verified that the detected phosphorylation changes in PS2 were not due to altered protein abundances (changes as determined by label-free quantification in MaxQuant (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Cox et al., 2014
     </xref>
     ) were less than twofold [
     <a>
      Supplementary file 2
     </a>
     ]).
    </p>
    <p>
     Next, we determined how many of the identified sites were significantly and robustly modulated. As we were interested in capturing the most strongly regulated sites, we required that the fold change had to be at least as strong as pS935-LRRK2. In PS1, we thus found 234 significantly regulated sites after treatment with each of the two LRRK2 compounds GSK2578215A and HG-10-102-01 (ANOVA, p&lt;0.005), with 78 sites regulated by both (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 2A
     </xref>
     ). Hierarchical clustering divided them into several subgroups (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C
     </xref>
     and
     <a>
      Supplementary file 3A
     </a>
     ). Besides revealing potential off-target sites of the two LRRK2 inhibitors, this identified a particularly interesting cluster containing 47 sites that were downregulated after treatment with both compounds (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1—figure supplement 2C
     </xref>
     , cluster 5).
    </p>
    <p>
     In PS2, we identified 204 significantly regulated sites (two sample t-test, FDR=0.01, S0=0.3), when comparing wild-type and inhibitor-resistant LRRK2 fibroblasts, with 128 sites specifically downregulated in the wild type, thus excluding off-target effects (
     <xref ref-type="fig">

     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, to stringently define LRRK2 substrates, we overlapped the results of the two orthogonal screens. Remarkably, only two phosphosites passed these stringent filtering criteria, our positive control pS935-LRRK2 and the conserved T73 residue of the small GTPase Rab10 (

    <p>
     Rab10 belongs to the Ras family of small GTPases that regulate intracellular vesicular transport, with ~70 members in human. They function as molecular switches in the tethering, docking, fusion, and motion of intracellular membranes (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Stenmark, 2009
     </xref>
     ;
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014
     </xref>
     ). The T73 residue of Rab10 is located in the switch II domain, which is characteristic of Rab GTPases (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2A
     </xref>
     ). This region changes conformation upon nucleotide binding and regulates the interaction with multiple regulatory proteins (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Pfeffer, 2005
     </xref>
     ). Sequence alignment revealed that the equivalent site to T73-Rab10 is highly conserved in more than 40 human Rab-family members, indicating strong functional relevance (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2B
     </xref>
     ). Moreover, superposing the crystal structures of multiple Rab GTPases localizes the equivalent residues to T73-Rab10 in nearly the same position (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2—figure supplement 1A

     ). To investigate whether the phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2 is direct, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant components. Notably, we found that both wt and LRRK2-G2019S, but neither kinase inactive D1994A mutant nor small molecule-inhibited LRRK2, efficiently phosphorylated Rab10, proving a direct kinase-substrate relationship (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2C
     </xref>
     ). Furthermore, incubation of Rab10 with LRRK2 followed by tryptic digestion and MS analysis unambiguously identified T73 as the major phosphorylation site (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2—figure supplement 1B
     </xref>
     ). Given the high conservation of T73-Rab10, we investigated whether other Rab GTPases were also phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro. Therefore, we first measured LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab8a, Rab1a, and Rab1b, all of which contain a Thr at the site equivalent to T73-Rab10, by MS or
     <sup>
      32
     </sup>
     P incorporation followed by Edman sequencing. Remarkably, all proteins were rapidly phosphorylated on the predicted LRRK2 phosphorylation site in the switch II domain (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2D–F
     </xref>
     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E
     </xref>
     ). Next, we compared Rab family members containing Thr sites in the switch II region with those containing a Ser in the equivalent position. Interestingly, while Rabs with threonines (Rab1b, Rab8a, and Rab10) were efficiently phosphorylated, those with the equivalent serine sites (Rab5b, Rab7a, Rab7L1, Rab12, and Rab39b) were phosphorylated to a drastically lower extent (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2G
     </xref>
     ). This confirms the previously reported in vitro preference for threonines by LRRK2 (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Nichols et al., 2009
     </xref>
     ). Finally, we performed a side by side comparison of the phosphorylation efficiencies of recombinant Rab8a and Rab7L1 against two previously reported substrates, moesin (Msn) and Rps15 (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Jaleel et al., 2007
     </xref>
     ;
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Martin et al., 2014
     </xref>
     ). Msn is a cytoskeletal protein and a well-known in vitro LRRK2 substrate, whereas Rps15 is part of the 40S ribosomal subunit and its phosphorylation on Thr136 has been reported to regulate protein translation in
     <em>
      D. melanogaster
     </em>
     (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Martin et al., 2014

     ). In accordance with our previous observations (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2G
     </xref>
     ), phosphorylation levels of RAB7L1 were barely detectable, and even lower than those of Msn and Rps15. Strikingly, levels of pRab8a were about ten times higher as compared to Rps15 and Msn, two of the best in vitro LRRK2 substrates known to date, demonstrating that Rabs with Thr sites in the switch II domain are primary LRRK2 targets (

     A subset of Rabs are physiological LRRK2 substrates
    </title>
    <p>
     Because of the high conservation of T73-Rab10 (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2B
     </xref>
     ) and the ability of LRRK2 to phosphorylate multiple Rabs in vitro, we inspected our quantitative MS data further to determine whether all sequence and structurally equivalent sites are targets of LRRK2. This turned out not to be the case as pS72-Rab7a was not regulated in either of our screens. LRRK2 thus phosphorylates only a subset of Rab GTPases in mouse fibroblasts. Surprisingly, we noticed that pS105-Rab12, which is not phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2G
     </xref>
     ), was among the significantly modulated sites in PS1 and also downregulated upon MLI-2 treatment in wt cells as compared to the inhibitor-resistant A2016T mutant in PS2 (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3A,B
     </xref>
     ). However, because of elevated intergroup variability and stringent FDR cut-offs, it was not selected in our first analysis. LRRK2 is found also in lower eukaryotes such as
     <em>
      C. elegans
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      D. melanogaster
     </em>
     (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Liu et al., 2011

     ) and T73-Rab10 is conserved in these organisms as well. Also, S105-Rab12 is present throughout the vertebrates (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3A,B
     </xref>
     ). We identified both pT73-Rab10 and pS105-Rab12 multiple times with high identification and phosphosite localization scores (

     ) and the MS/MS fragmentation spectra of the corresponding synthetic peptides independently validated the MS results (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B
     </xref>
     ). Total protein levels of Rab10 and Rab12 did not change appreciably in the A2016T knock-in model as judged by quantitative MS analysis, ruling out that that the observed phospho-level changes are due to differential protein expression (

     To extend the analysis of LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10, we used human embryonic kidney cells harboring doxycycline-dependent gene expression of LRRK2-G2019S (HEK293-t-rex-flpIn). Expression of the kinase, treatment with either GSK2578215A or HG-10-102-01 and enrichment of Rab10 by immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative MS analysis confirmed a strong, LRRK2-dependent decrease of pT73-Rab10 peptide levels (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3—figure supplement 2B
     </xref>
     ). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing pT73-Rab10 and pS106-Rab12 (note that the equivalent site is S105 in mouse) independently verified LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of both Rab isoforms in HEK293 cells (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3C,D
     </xref>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Next, we evaluated whether more Rab isoforms can be phosphorylated in a LRRK2-dependent manner in human cells, focusing on Rab1a, Rab3a, and Rab8a, all of which contain Thr as predicted LRRK2 phosphorylation site (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2B
     </xref>
     ). Therefore, we first ectopically expressed LRRK2 along with either Rab1a or Rab3a, in presence or absence of HG-10-102-01 and quantified pT75-Rab1a and pT86-Rab3a peptide levels by MS. Whereas T86-Rab3a is clearly a LRRK2 target, Rab1a is not, indicating that overexpression of LRRK2 is not sufficient to phosphorylate all Rabs in cells (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D
     </xref>
     ). Next, we inhibited LRRK2 in HEK293-t-rex-flpIn cells expressing LRRK2-G2019S and quantified pT72-Rab8. Again, we found a strong decrease of pT72 peptide levels upon LRRK2 inhibition with both GSK2578215A and HG-10-102-01 (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3—figure supplement 2E
     </xref>
     ). An antibody raised for specific detection for pT72-Rab8 confirmed these results further (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 2E
     </xref>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     To analyze LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rabs in an endogenous context, we quantified pT72-Rab8 and pT73-Rab10 peptide levels in MEFs derived from LRRK2 knockout, wt, or G2019S
     <sup>
      GSK
     </sup>
     animals. In the knock-out, the decrease was only about twofold compared to wt, implying a very low intrinsic LRRK2 activity in cells. Consistent with the two- to threefold increased in vitro activity of MEFs-extracted LRRK2-G2019S
     <sup>
      GSK
     </sup>
     (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 1B
     </xref>
     ), our quantitative MS analysis revealed a threefold increase in both pT72-Rab8 and pT73-Rab10, which was restored to near wt levels by selective LRRK2 kinase inhibition (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3—figure supplement 2F–I
     </xref>
     ). Finally, we globally measured the brain phosphoproteome of LRRK2-G2019S
     <sup>
      Lilly
     </sup>
     mice injected with vehicle (40% HPβCD) or with MLI-2 (3 mg/kg). Levels of pT72-Rab8 and pS105-Rab12 were decreased more than twofold upon LRRK2 inhibition, validating our findings in the context of a LRRK2 pathogenic mouse model (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3F,G
     </xref>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Having identified Rabs as physiological substrates of LRRK2, we next asked if kinase and substrate also stably interact. Indeed, affinity-purification mass-spectrometry (AP-MS) showed that transiently expressed epitope-tagged LRRK2 and Rab8a efficiently associated with each other, demonstrating that LRRK2 is able to form stable complexes with Rab GTPases in cells (
     <xref ref-type="fig">

     </xref>
     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B
     </xref>
     ). Similarly, Rab10 as well as Rab12 associate with LRRK2 when transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells (

     Pathogenic PD LRRK2 mutations predominantly map to the kinase and the ROC-COR (GTPase) domains and a PD risk factor coding mutation is also found in the WD-40 domain (

Because it is presently unclear how mutations occurring in distinct LRRK2 functional domains lead to similar disease phenotypes, we decided to investigate if different LRRK2 pathogenic mutations might impact on the phosphorylation status of Rab GTPases. For this, we expressed different disease causing LRRK2 variants along with either Rab8a or Rab10 in HEK293 cells. This revealed that besides PD-associated mutations located in the kinase domain that augment LRRK2 kinase activity, those occurring in the GTPase (ROC-COR) or the WD-40 domains also increased pT72-Rab8a and pT73-Rab10 levels in cells (

     To determine whether this interplay between different functional domains was direct, we next tested whether pathogenic LRRK2 mutations which lie outside the kinase domain also increase Rab phosphorylation in vitro. As expected, compared to wt, the G2019S mutation resulted in a two- to threefold increase in Rab8a phosphorylation. However, the ROC-COR domain R1441C mutation failed to do so, which is consistent with previous data suggesting that these mutations do not directly enhance LRRK2 kinase activity (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Nichols et al., 2010

     Rab GTPases consist of a similar core structure comprising highly conserved P-loop, switch I and switch II regions (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Pfeffer, 2005
     </xref>
     ). They cycle between the cytosol, in which they are GDP bound and inactive and specific membrane compartments, where they are activated by GDP/GTP exchange (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Hutagalung and Novick, 2011
     </xref>
     ). In the crystal structure of Rab8a (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Guo et al., 2013
     </xref>
     ), the LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation site is in the switch II region (

     ), which regulates hydrolysis of GTP and coordinates the binding to various regulatory proteins (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Pfeffer, 2005
     </xref>
     ). We therefore tested whether the phosphomimetic T72E substitution would modulate GDP/GTP binding or interfere with Rab8a protein interactions. Binding affinities of wt and the TE mutant, determined with fluorescently labeled (N-Methylanthraniloyl, mant) GDP and non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMPPNP, did not differ (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 5—figure supplement 1

These were Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors α and β (GDI1 and GDI2), Rab geranyltransferase complex members (CHM, CHML, and RabGGTA/RabGGTB), the Rab8a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rabin8 (Rab3IP), a guanine nucleotide activating protein TBC1D15 and the inositol phosphatase INPP5B (

     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Westlake et al., 2011
     </xref>
     ). This in turn triggers retention of Rab effector proteins that mediate downstream vesicular trafficking events. Rabin8 binds to the switch II domain of Rab8a and contacts the conserved, phosphorylatable T72 residue (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 5—figure supplement 2A
     </xref>
     ) (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Guo et al., 2013
     </xref>
     ). We found that compared to wt, the T72E phosphomimetic substitution decreased the level of Rabin8-catalyzed mant-GDP displacement from a Rab8-GDP complex (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–D
     </xref>
     ). To further substantiate this finding, we phosphorylated purified Rab8a using LRRK2, which resulted in ~60% of T72-phosphorylated protein as determined by total protein MS and LC-MS/MS after tryptic digestion (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 5—figure supplement 2E,F
     </xref>
     ). Further enrichment by ion-exchange chromatography yielded a highly enriched (~100%) fraction of pT72-Rab8a (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 5—figure supplement 2E
     </xref>
     ). Loading of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Rab8a with mant-GDP following incubation with Rabin8 revealed that LRRK2-induced phosphorylation of T72-Rab8a inhibits rates of Rabin8-catalyzed GDP exchange fourfold and decreases Rab8a-Rabin8 interaction (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figures 5D
     </xref>
     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 5—figure supplement 2G
     </xref>
     ). Both λ-phosphatase treatment of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8a and pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 prevented the decreased GEF activity of Rabin8 toward pT72-Rab8a (

     and
     <xref ref-type="fig">

     ). Thus, phosphorylation of Rab8a by LRRK2 can limit its activation by Rabin8.

     PD pathogenic LRRK2 mutations interfere with Rab-GDI1/2 association
    </title>
    <p>
     GDI1 and GDI2, along with CHM and CHML (also known as Rab escorting proteins REP1 and REP2) form the GDI superfamily and are essential regulators of the Rab cycle. GDIs extract inactive, prenylated Rabs from membranes and bind them with high affinity in the cytosol (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Pylypenko et al., 2003
     </xref>
     ). The regulatory mechanism by which Rabs are displaced from GDIs to facilitate their insertion into specific target membranes is unknown. The co-crystal structure of GDI1 with the yeast Rab homologue Ypt1 shows that GDIs closely contact the switch II region (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Rak, 2003
     </xref>
     ), which explains why phosphorylation in this domain interferes with the Rab-GDI interaction. Since GDIs are not specific to one Rab isoform (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Seabra and Wasmeier, 2004
     </xref>
     ), we reasoned that phosphorylation of the switch II domain could be a general mechanism of Rab-GDI dissociation. We therefore substituted S106-Rab12 and T73-Rab10 with non-phosphorylatable Ala or phosphomimetic Glu residues and tested their capacity to form complexes with GDIs by immunoprecipitation followed by MS or western blotting. As compared to non-phosphorylatable Rab10 and Rab12, neither S106E-Rab12 nor T73E-Rab10 was able to bind GDIs, demonstrating the functional importance of these residues (

     To further analyze the effect of Rab phosphorylation and GDI dissociation in the context of PD, we expressed LRRK2 variants harboring various pathogenic mutations along with Rab8a in cells and assessed Rab-GDI complex formation by immunoprecipitation. Strikingly, the level of Rab8a-GDI interaction closely correlated with the degree of T72-Rab8a phosphorylation (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 6C,D
     </xref>
     ). Similarly, LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of S106-Rab12 diminished the interaction with GDIs, confirming that the effect is not specific to one Rab isoform (
     <xref ref-type="fig">
      Figure 6E,F
     </xref>
     ). All tested LRRK2 pathogenic mutations that affect kinase activity thus control the interaction of Rabs with GDIs. Finally, to directly test whether disruption of the Rab-GDI interaction results in an altered subcellular distribution of Rabs, we quantitatively determined T72A-Rab8 and T72E-Rab8 protein abundances in SILAC (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">

    Discussion
   </title>
   <p>
    Here, we used a state of art MS-based phosphoproteomics workflow in combination with cells of two genetically engineered mouse models as well as a mixture of selective LRRK2 compounds to define LRRK2 targets with high stringency. Starting with almost 30,000 identified phosphosites, our screens rapidly narrowed down the candidates to a small number that were consistently and strongly regulated with all tested compounds and genetic models. Only the known phosphorylation site pS935 on LRRK2 itself and a specific residue in the Rab10 GTPase (T73) fulfilled our most specific criteria. LRRK2 kinase is conserved also in flies and worms and this is true of the T73-Rab10 substrate site as well. Further experiments with diverse model systems and techniques all verified the T73-Rab10 site as well as the equivalent sites on many but not all other Rab family members. These include the threonine sites on Rab8a and Rab3a (T72 and T86, respectively), as well as S106-Rab12. Rab7a is an important component of the endocytic pathway (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014
    </xref>
    ) and phosphorylation on S72 has recently been shown to play a functional role in B-cell signaling (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Satpathy et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). While our data clearly show that this site is not regulated by LRRK2 in mouse fibroblasts, its regulation by LRRK2 in B cells remains possible, given the high expression levels of LRRK2 in those cell types (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Gardet et al., 2010
    </xref>
    ). In vitro experiments proved that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates Thr but not the Ser sites in Rab isoforms, in line with its well-established in vitro preference (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Jaleel et al., 2007
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Martin et al., 2014
    </xref>
    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Nichols et al., 2009
    </xref>
    ). We found that Ser sites on Rabs were hardly phosphorylated in vitro but S105-Rab12 (S106 in human) was clearly regulated in cells and brain tissue, establishing that accessory factors are required in this case. Consistent with this finding, the major characterized in vivo LRRK2 autophosphorylation site is a Ser residue (Ser1292) (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Sheng et al., 2012
    </xref>
    ). Our observation of residual Thr72-Rab8 phosphorylation in LRRK2
    <sup>
     -/-
    </sup>
    mice implies that one or more other kinase(s) are able to act upon this residue.
   </p>
   <p>
    Besides defining Rab GTPases as LRRK2 targets, our screens identified a number of phosphosites as potential LRRK2 targets. However, these were validated by only one of the screens, their regulation was weaker and for many of them regulation may reflect indirect modulation by the LRRK2 kinase. This is likely to account for the difficulty in identifying substrates of this kinase. In a direct comparison of threonine Rab phosphorylation it was much stronger than the known in vitro LRRK2 targets we tested. Overall, the relatively small number of regulated sites in our screens, suggest that LRRK2 is a very specific or low activity kinase. LRRK2 is ubiquitously expressed, but highly abundant in the kidney, lungs, pancreas, and certain cell types of the immune system (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Schapansky et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). Therefore, it is possible that different LRRK2 substrates, including Rab isoforms, are phosphorylated in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. Further phosphoproteomic research should shed more light on this open question. We conclude that the threonine sites on Rab family members identified here may not be the only functional ones in the context of LRRK2, but that they are the most prominent ones.
   </p>
   <p>
    In searching for a functional role for LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation, we noted that it maps onto the switch II region, which is known to mediate GDP/GTP exchange as well as interaction with regulatory proteins. Results from nucleotide affinity measurements make the former mechanism unlikely but AP-MS established phosphorylation-dependent binding of several proteins involved in regulating their cycling between cytosol and membrane compartments. This indicates that direct phosphorylation of Rabs on a conserved residue situated in the switch II domain regulates their movement by controlling the interaction with numerous regulatory proteins. The affinities of GDIs for Rabs are vastly decreased in a manner correlating with the phosphorylation levels induced by different LRRK2 pathogenic variants. Our data thus establish that LRRK2 is an important regulator of Rab homeostasis which is likely contributing to PD development (
    <xref ref-type="fig">
     Figure 7A
    </xref>
    ). Overactive LRRK2, which results in increased Rab phosphorylation, promotes dissociation from GDIs in the cytosol with concomitant membrane insertion (
    <xref ref-type="fig">
     Figure 7B
    </xref>
    ). In this way, the relative pool of membrane bound and cytosolic Rab is altered, disturbing intracellular trafficking. In particular, PD-associated LRRK2 mutations would shift the membrane-cytosol balance of Rabs toward the membrane compartment, thereby causing accumulation of inactive Rabs in the membranes (
    <xref ref-type="fig">
     Figure 7B
    </xref>
    ). The subtle increase in Rab phosphorylation in cells derived from LRRK2-G2019S knock-in mice is consistent with the long time needed for PD to manifest in humans.

      ) Rab GTPases (Rabs) cycle between an inactive (GDP-bound) and an active state (GTP-bound) between cytosol and membranes, respectively. Geranyl-geranyl-modified Rab GTPases in their GDP-bound state are tightly bound by guanine dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) in the cytosol. LRRK2 aids the insertion of Rabs in their specific target membrane. After removal of the LRRK2 phosphorylation site, guanine exchange factors (GEFs) facilitate exchange of GDP to GTP. This in turn allows binding to effector proteins and membrane trafficking events. Next, a Rab-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) assists in the hydrolysis of GTP followed by removal of the Rab GTPase from the target membrane by GDIs. (

      ) In pathogenic conditions, in which LRRK2 is hyperactive, RabGTPases have strongly diminished affinities for GDIs. As a result, the equilibrium between membrane-bound and cytosolic Rabs is disturbed, which may contribute to LRRK2 mutant carrier disease phenotypes. Model adapted and modified from (

    Intriguingly, our results show that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations outside the kinase domain can also increase Rab phosphorylation. Although our in vitro data clearly shows that this mechanism is indirect, they will still act on the same pathway as kinase domain mutants. Therefore, the same model would also be applicable in this case.

    Independent evidence that Rabs are likely to be primary LRRK2 substrates comes from LRRK2 knockout animal studies. LRRK2

    mice and rats have deformed kidneys and lungs, indicative of defects in the autophagosome/lysosome pathway, which depend on properly tuned Rab activity (

    ;
    <xref ref-type="bibr">

    ). Moreover, it was recently reported that LRRK2 and Rab2a regulate Paneth cell function, which is compromised in Crohn’s disease (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     Zhang et al., 2015
    </xref>
    ). In this context, it is interesting that we found pS70-Rab2a/b to be regulated in our second screen, although it’s very low abundance impedes meaningful statistical interpretation. Taken together these observations make it plausible that LRRK2 regulates Rab2a by direct phosphorylation of S70 in specialized cell types.
   </p>
   <p>
    In conclusion, we prove that LRRK2 induces phosphorylation of Rabs and provide evidence that it deregulates cycling between cytosol and target membrane compartments. It will be interesting to investigate whether the Rab regulatory mechanism uncovered here is of key importance in vesicular trafficking in general. Discovery of a key physiological LRRK2 substrate should inform and accelerate research into PD, including monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic intervention.

     The LRRK2-G2019S
     <sup>
      GSK
     </sup>
     knock-in mouse line was generated by a targeting strategy devised to introduce the point mutation G2019S into exon 41 of the LRRK2 gene by homologous recombination in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. 5’ and 3’ homology arms (approximately 4.8 and 3.8 kb, respectively) flanking exon 41 were generated using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs) on a C57BL/6J genomic DNA template. Similarly a 739 bp fragment carrying exon 41 lying between these two homology arms was isolated and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis with the QuickChangeII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to introduce the appropriate point mutation (GG to TC mutation at bps 107/8). The 5’ and 3’ homology arms and the mutated exon 41 fragments were subcloned into a parental targeting vector to achieve the positioning of the loxP and FRT sites and PGKneo cassette. Gene targeting was performed in de novo generated C57BL/6J-derived ES cells. The targeting construct was linearized and electroporated into ES cells according to standard methods. ES cells correctly targeted at the 3’ end were identified by Southern blot analysis of

      Eco
     </em>
     RV digested genomic DNA using a PCR-derived external probe. Correct gene targeting at the 5’ end and presence of the point mutation was confirmed by sequencing of a ~6 kb PCR product. High-fidelity PCR of ES cell clone-derived genomic DNA using primers spanning the 5’ homology arm generated the latter. Correctly targeted ES cell clones were injected into BALB/c blastocysts and implanted into foster mothers according to standard procedures. Male chimaeras resulting from the G2019S targeted ES cells were bred with C57BL/6J female mice, and germline transmission of the targeted allele was confirmed by PCR. The PGKneo cassette was subsequently removed by breeding germline mice to FLPeR (
     <xref ref-type="bibr">
      Farley et al., 2000
     </xref>
     ) mice expressing Flp recombinase from the Rosa26 locus (C57BL/6J genetic background). Absence of the PGKneo cassette in offspring was confirmed by PCR and subsequent breeding to C57BL/6J mice removed the Flper locus (confirmed by PCR). The line was maintained by breeding with C57BL/6J, and crossing mice heterozygous for the point mutation generated homozygous mice. Standard genotyping which distinguishes wild type from point mutation knock-in alleles was used throughout. Requests for LRRK2 G2019SGSK mice should be directed to: alastair.d.reith@gsk.com.

     The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research generated the A2016T knock-in mice. A targeting vector was designed to introduce an alanine to threonine (A2016T) substitution at codon 2016 in exon 41 of the endogenous locus. In addition, an FRT-flanked neomycin resistance (neo) cassette was introduced 400 bp downstream of exon 41. The construct was electroporated into C57BL/6N-derived JM8 ES cells. Correctly targeted ES cells were injected into blastocysts and chimeric mice were bred to B6.Cg-Tg (ACTFLPe)9205Dym/J (JAX stock No. 005703) to remove the neo cassette and leave a silent FRT site. The resulting animals were crossed to C57BL/6NJ inbred mice (JAX stock No. 005304) for one generation. These mice are available from The Jackson Laboratory and for further information see

Individual MS/MS spectra were inspected using Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and Proteome Discoverer with phosphoRS 3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to assist with phosphosite assignment. The site of phosphorylation of 32P-labeled peptides was determined by solid-phase Edman degradation on a Shimadzu PPSQ33A Sequencer of the peptide coupled to Sequelon-AA membrane (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (

     Rab8a was phosphorylated using LRRK2-G2019S (see ‘in vitro kinase assays’ section). Non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Rab8a proteins were separated using ion-exchange chromatography (Mono S 4.6/100; GE Healthcare) with a linear salt gradient from buffer A (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) to buffer B (as buffer A, but with 1000 mM NaCl). The successful enrichment of phosphorylated Rab8a was confirmed by ESI-TOF MS.

Spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer; 1 µM of methylanthraniloyl (mant) labeled GMPPNP and GDP was incubated with increasing concentrations of wild type and T72E Rab8a in 60 µl volumes. Fluorescence of mant-nucleotides was excited at 355 nm and emission spectra monitored from 400 to 500 nm, with emission maxima detected at 448 nm. Intrinsic protein fluorescence and mant-nucleotide background fluorescence was subtracted from the curves.
