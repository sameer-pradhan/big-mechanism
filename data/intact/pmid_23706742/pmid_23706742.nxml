In mammals, there exist four isoforms of the type I PI3K catalytic p110 subunits: &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, and &#x003b4;. Of these, &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are ubiquitously expressed, whereas &#x003b3; and &#x003b4; have more limited distribution, most notably in hematopoietic cells (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaesebroeck et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). The lipid kinase activity of p110&#x003b1; is regulated downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases by the binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to its regulatory p85 subunit, resulting in attenuation of its autoinhibitory activity. In addition, activated RAS proteins bind directly to an N-terminal RAS-binding domain (RBD) on p110&#x003b1;, acting synergistically with the input from tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to optimally activate lipid kinase activity (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Viciana et&#x000a0;al., 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Proof of the pathophysiological importance of the direct interaction of RAS with p110&#x003b1; came from the generation of mice bearing germline mutations in the RBD of p110&#x003b1;, which were found to be highly resistant to mutant-RAS-induced lung and skin cancer formation (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The direct binding of RAS to p110&#x003b3; has also been studied in detail. The 3D structure of RAS bound to p110&#x003b3; has been determined, and RAS has been shown to activate the lipid kinase activity of p110&#x003b3; cooperatively with input from G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits via the regulatory p101 subunit (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Pacold et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). Mice with mutations in the RBD of p110&#x003b3; show neutrophil defects in the regulation of PI3K activity by some G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Suire et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). RAS also has been reported to bind and activate p110&#x003b4; in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Vanhaesebroeck et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). In addition, RBD mutations have been used to demonstrate that input of RAS binding to the single <italic>Drosophila</italic> type I PI3K is critical in insulin-pathway-controlled developmental growth (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Orme et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) and that RAS binding is required for PI3K activation by chemoattractants in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Funamoto et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>p110&#x003b2; has been much less thoroughly studied than p110&#x003b1;. It appears to be relatively insensitive to activation by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling but important downstream of certain GPCRs, including those for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), making p110&#x003b2; the only GPCR-regulated type I PI3K isoform outside the hematopoietic system (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ciraolo et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Guillermet-Guibert et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jia et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). p110&#x003b2; may also play an important role in cancer because mouse models of breast and prostate cancer, as well as a number of human cancer cell lines, depend on p110&#x003b2;, particularly in the setting of PTEN loss (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Ciraolo et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Jia et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). In platelets, p110&#x003b2; is essential for integrin-dependent adhesion and clot formation (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Martin et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>), leading to the intense effort to develop isoform-specific&#x000a0;p110&#x003b2; inhibitors, some of which are now in clinical trials&#x000a0;as antiplatelet and anticancer agents (NCT01458067, NCT00688714).</p><p>The molecular basis of how p110&#x003b2; can exert these distinct functions is poorly understood. p110&#x003b2; is overall structurally similar to other p110 catalytic subunits and engages the very same p85 type regulatory subunits as p110&#x003b1;, albeit in a somewhat different way (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Early reports have found p110&#x003b2; to associate with G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits from heterotrimeric G proteins, which can directly stimulate its lipid kinase activity in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kurosu et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Maier et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). It has, however, remained entirely unclear whether the p110&#x003b2; RBD contributes to p110&#x003b2; activation and function, and despite the apparently similar level of relatedness between the RBDs across the four isoforms, a systematic analysis of RAS effector proteins failed to detect any activation of p110&#x003b2; by RAS in cotransfected cells (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Viciana et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we explore the role of p110&#x003b2; regulation through its RBD for PI3K signaling and function. We present extensive in&#x000a0;vitro work to show that p110&#x003b2; is the only type I PI3K isoform not regulated by RAS and to identify the RHO family GTPases RAC and CDC42 as direct isoform-specific RBD interactors and activators of p110&#x003b2;. We go on to show that GPCRs couple to PI3K via Dock180/Elmo1-mediated RAC activation and subsequent interaction with p110&#x003b2;. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from p110&#x003b2; RBD mutant mice show reduced PI3K activity and mice are resistant to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, a pathology that has been linked with LPA signaling. These findings explain longstanding inconsistencies and revise our understanding of type I PI3K regulation by small GTP-binding proteins, providing molecular insight into the regulation and function of the ubiquitous p110&#x003b2; isoform.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>PI3K p110&#x003b2; Is Not a RAS Target Protein</title><p>To investigate the role of RAS in regulating p110&#x003b2;, we set out to characterize the biochemical interaction between the two in&#x000a0;vitro. In glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down studies using recombinant, GTP&#x003b3;S-loaded HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS as baits, we found strong and specific interaction between all three RAS proteins and p110&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). In contrast, p110&#x003b2; bound to none of the RAS proteins, but did bind to RAB5, a previously identified GTPase interactor of p110&#x003b2; (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Christoforidis et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Mutating key residues within the RBD of p110&#x003b1; (T208D/K227A) abrogated RAS binding, whereas introduction of analogous mutations (see below for details) into p110&#x003b2; did not affect RAB5 binding. Similar results were obtained when we used recombinant full-length GST-p110/p85 complexes to pull down active RAS or RAB5 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Moreover, when we expressed constitutively active RAS or RAB5, along with p110&#x003b1;/p85 or p110&#x003b2;/p85 in COS7 cells, and measured PIP<sub>3</sub>-levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C) or steady-state phospho-AKT (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A available online) as indicators of PI3K activity, HRAS and KRAS strongly enhanced p110&#x003b1; activity, whereas p110&#x003b2; was not stimulated by either RAS proteins or RAB5.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>An Intact RBD Is Essential for p110&#x003b2; Activity in Cells</title><p>The modest RBD sequence similarity among the four paralogs of type I PI3K is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D. Even though the overall structural organization of the p110&#x003b2; RBD is conserved (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), we speculated that because we cannot detect any interaction with RAS, it might have lost or altered its function. We therefore mutated two highly conserved key residues within the p110&#x003b2; RBD to generate a p110&#x003b2;-S205D/K224A double mutant (p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E). Analogous mutations in p110&#x003b1; and p110&#x003b3; disrupt RAS binding (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gupta et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Pacold et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). In&#x000a0;vitro, the basal lipid kinase activity of purified recombinant p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM protein was indistinguishable from its wild-type counterpart prepared in parallel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>F). Moreover, p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM was still stimulated by the addition of purified recombinant G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits, alone or in combination with a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-derived phosphotyrosine peptide (pY740), indicating that the RBD mutations had no intrinsic effect on p110&#x003b2; lipid kinase activity or RBD-independent stimulatory input (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>G). However, RBD mutant p110&#x003b2; was much less active than wild-type when expressed in COS7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>H and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>B) even when G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits were coexpressed or a myristoylation signal was added, pointing to a critical role of the RBD for p110&#x003b2; activity in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>p110&#x003b2; Interacts with Distinct RAS Subfamily GTPases</title><p>To identify RBD interactors of p110&#x003b2;, we probed all 34 murine members of the RAS subfamily of small GTPases (RFGs) for binding to p110&#x003b2;/p85 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C).

Strikingly, whereas all non-&#x003b2; isoforms interacted with the three prototypical RAS proteins and a partially overlapping subset of closely related RFGs (RRAS1, RRAS2, MRAS, and ERAS), p110&#x003b2; bound to none of those (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A).

DIRAS selectively bound wild-type and not RBD mutant p110&#x003b2; (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>B), suggesting binding to the RBD. However, DIRAS failed to stimulate p110&#x003b2; lipid kinase activity in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C) and in cells, where constitutively active DIRAS proteins seemed to repress rather than elevate phospho-AKT when coexpressed along with p110&#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), making DIRAS an unlikely in&#x000a0;vivo activator of p110&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>p110&#x003b2; Is a Direct RAC/CDC42 Target Protein</title><p>When comparing DIRAS with RAS, an obvious difference is the substitution of Asp33 within the G2 box of RAS with Ile37 in DIRAS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). This substitution is relevant to PI3K binding because an HRAS-D33I mutant showed attenuated binding to p110&#x003b1; and DIRAS1-I37D showed reduced binding to p110&#x003b2;, even though exchange of this residue did not enable RAS binding to p110&#x003b2; or DIRAS binding to p110&#x003b1; (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A), pointing to additional, G2-box-independent determinants of PI3K isoform specificity. Several members of the RHO subfamily of small GTPases harbor a hydrophobic isoleucine or valine residue in this position (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>C), which prompted us to test p110&#x003b2; for binding to representative RHO family GTPases (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>D). Surprisingly, p110&#x003b2; bound to both RAC1 and CDC42 in a GTP-dependent manner. Weaker binding to RHOG and minimal binding to RHOA was also observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E). Importantly, RAC1, CDC42, RHOG, and RHOA preparations bound similar amounts of GTP, indicating proper folding and functionality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>E, right lower graph), and a RAC1-I33D mutant showed reduced binding to p110&#x003b2; (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>E), confirming a key role of this residue in GTPase binding to p110&#x003b2;.</p><p>The RAC1/CDC42-p110&#x003b2; interaction was isoform specific because neither RAC1 nor CDC42 significantly bound non-&#x003b2; isoforms under parallel conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>F and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>F).

The residual p110&#x003b2; activity in p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM MEFs argues for a second, RBD-independent activation route, for which direct binding of G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; to p110&#x003b2; (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Dbouk et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>) is the most obvious candidate. A puzzling question is whether a cooperative effect of RBD interactor and G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; binding to p110&#x003b2; can suffice to fully activate p110&#x003b2;, or if additional phosphotyrosine input is required to overcome the strong inhibition of lipid kinase activity imposed by p85 (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>).

Although we found no effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and no p85 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to LPA in support of such a mechanism in MEFs, there is evidence for cooperative GPCR and phosphotyrosine signaling to p110&#x003b2; in leukocytes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Kulkarni et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), and such a scenario appears possible in thrombocytes, where p110&#x003b2; is activated by integrins, ITAM-bearing receptors, and GPCRs (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Martin et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.5"><title>Dock180/Elmo1 Couples GPCRs to RAC and p110&#x003b2;</title><p>RAC1 is essential for p110&#x003b2; activation downstream of the GPCRs for LPA and S1P, and the RAC-GEF Dock180/Elmo1 is upstream of both RAC and p110&#x003b2; in this pathway. The Dock/Elmo-RAC signaling axis is a highly conserved pathway controlling RAC-dependent key functions such as actin remodeling, migration, and phagocytosis (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">C&#x000f4;t&#x000e9; et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Recent findings in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> have directly linked G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits from GPCRs to Dock/Elmo-RAC and the cytoskeleton (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Yan et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Reminiscent of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ElmoE, we find the N terminus of human Elmo1 to directly bind G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits, suggesting conservation of this pathway in mammals. In line with this, PI3K activity is not required for RAC activation by LPA, placing p110&#x003b2; entirely downstream of RAC in fibroblasts, which contrasts with a proposed PIP<sub>3</sub>-driven feedback loop controlling RAC activity upstream and downstream of PI3K in leukocytes (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Weiner et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). Although PI3K is not required to activate RAC, it is still essential for fibroblast migration in gradients of LPA, indicating that PIP<sub>3</sub>-regulated pathways distinct from RAC activation contribute to GPCR-driven chemotaxis. Importantly, whereas our findings identify Dock180/Elmo1 downstream of LPA/S1P in MEFs, our experiments cannot rule out involvement of other RAC-GEFs within this pathway. We also cannot directly prove that the role of Dock180/Elmo1 in controlling fibroblast migration is exclusively and directly through activation of RAC upstream of p110&#x003b2;. Finally, different GPCRs and other cell types may signal through RAC-GEFs other than Dock180/Elmo1, and further studies will be required to determine whether the Dock180/Elmo1-RAC1-p110&#x003b2; axis is a fixed signaling module or just one example of how RAC/CDC42 is activated upstream of p110&#x003b2;.</p><p>Overall, the picture that emerges from these studies is one in which p110&#x003b2; regulation by GPCRs operates through a two-track signaling pathway with direct and indirect input into p110&#x003b2;. The direct route involves G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; interaction with p110&#x003b2;, whereas the indirect route goes through stimulation of RAC via Dock180/Elmo1, possibly also recruited through G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F). Such two-track wiring is reminiscent of receptor tyrosine kinase regulation of p110&#x003b1; via p85 interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor or adaptor protein and Grb2-Sos-RAS-p110&#x003b1; interaction. It can be speculated that this signaling logic might provide an improved ability to amplify a weak signal input or might increase the possibility for fine-tuning the signal through crosstalk of other pathways onto components such as Dock180/Elmo1, RAC itself, or RAC-GAPs terminating RAC activity. Another interesting issue is whether such G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-Elmo1 and G&#x003b2;&#x003b3;-p110&#x003b2; interactions are mutually exclusive or can occur in a heterotrimeric complex. At present, we cannot distinguish between a model in which one G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; protein heterodimer binds directly to both Elmo1 and p110&#x003b2; simultaneously and one in which Elmo and p110&#x003b2; are engaged by two different G&#x003b2;&#x003b3; protein heterodimers (as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F).</p><p>See <xref rid="app2" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Information</xref> online for the <xref rid="dtbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Extended Discussion</xref>, including information on other GTPase interactors of p110&#x003b2;, the phenotype of p110&#x003b2;-RBD mutant mice, and resistance of these mice to bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis.</p><p><boxed-text id="dtbox1"><label>Extended Discussion</label><sec id="dtbox1sec1"><title>Other GTPase Interactors of p110&#x003b2;</title><p>The only small GTPase previously found to interact with p110&#x003b2; is RAB5. p110&#x003b2;/p85 copurified with RAB5 in a study searching for RAB5 interactors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Christoforidis et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>) and RAB5 was identified in a yeast two hybrid screen searching for p110&#x003b2; interactors (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kurosu and Katada, 2001</xref>). p110&#x003b2; appears to associate with RAB5 in the early endocytic pathway, where it has been proposed to indirectly contribute to PtdIns(3)P formation (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Shin et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), and RAB5 and p110&#x003b2; have further been suggested to be part of the autophagy-promoting Vps34&#x02013;Vps15&#x02013;Beclin1&#x02013;Atg14L complex (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Dou et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).

A straightforward comparison between RBD mutant mice and these models is, however, complicated not only by different genetic backgrounds, but also by the different genetics of these models.

A milder phenotype of p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM mice is after all not unexpected, given that the RBD mutations do not disrupt basal p110&#x003b2; activity or RBD-independent activation routes, and some p110&#x003b2; activity might be enough for normal development and life under controlled conditions. We also saw moderately reduced proliferation of p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM primary MEFs, indicating that p110&#x003b2; regulation through its RBD interactors is essential for normal cell proliferation, which appears to contradict findings from &#x003b2;-KD MEFs and reconstituted p110&#x003b2;-KO MEFs suggesting that p110&#x003b2; lipid kinase activity is not required for proliferation.

An FRT-flanked neomycin selection cassette (Genebridges) was PCR-amplified and inserted into murine genomic DNA immediately downstream of <italic>Pik3cb</italic> exon 6 in a murine BAC clone, using Red/ET recombination technology (Genebridges). Selection cassette and flanking arms of genomic DNA (arms of homology, 4kb upstream and 2kb downstream of exon 6, respectively) were subcloned into a targeting vector backbone taken from PGKneolox2DTA.2 (Phil Soriano), again by using Red/ET-based recombination in <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic>. Plasmid DNA was isolated and mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange XL, Stratagene). The targeting construct was fully sequenced, linearized, and electroporated into C57BL/6 ES cells. Neomycin-resistant ES cell clones were screened for homologous recombination by genomic PCR bridging the short arm of the construct and confirmed by PCRs bridging the long arm of homology and the entire targeting region (biallelic PCR). Takara LA-Taq DNA polymerase was used for amplification of long genomic fragments. Several correctly targeted ES clones were injected into blastocysts or 8-cell embryos and implanted into pseudopregnant foster mothers following standard techniques. Offspring of chimera was genotyped for germline transmission. Two independent founder lines were maintained, and mutations were confirmed by genomic sequencing. The neomycin selection cassette was removed by crosses of heterozygous p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM mice with FLPe deleter mice, leaving a single FRT site in intron 6/7, which was used for PCR genotyping. Genotyping was later outsourced to an automated genotyping provider (Transnetyx).</p></sec><sec id="dtbox2sec10"><title>Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts</title><p>To generate wild-type and homozygous p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM MEFs, E13.5 mouse embryos from intercrosses of heterozygous p110&#x003b2;-RBD-DM mice were collected, minced and trypsinized.
