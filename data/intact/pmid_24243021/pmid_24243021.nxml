To address the molecular basis of this SpoIV transmembrane signaling, we carried out a structure-function analysis of the activating protease CtpB. Crystal structures reflecting distinct functional states show that CtpB constitutes a ring-like protein scaffold penetrated by two narrow tunnels. Access to the proteolytic sites sequestered within these tunnels is controlled by PDZ domains that rearrange upon substrate binding. Accordingly, CtpB resembles a minimal version of a self-compartmentalizing protease regulated by a unique allosteric mechanism. Moreover, biochemical analysis of the PDZ-gated channel combined with sporulation assays reveal that activation of the SpoIV RIP pathway is induced by the concerted activity of CtpB and a second signaling protease, SpoIVB. This proteolytic mechanism is of broad relevance for cell-cell communication, illustrating how distinct signaling pathways can be integrated into a single RIP module.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>The CtpB fold composes a narrow protease tunnel gated by a PDZ domain</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Substrate binding induces opening of the PDZ gate and protease activation</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>SpoIVB and CtpB signaling proteases act in a sequential and concerted fashion</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>SpoIVB and CtpB establish a RIP mechanism to integrate multiple cellular signals</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>Bacterial sporulation depends on cleavage of a membrane-bound inhibitor by CtpB, a protease gated by its own PDZ domain.

However, differentiation into specialized cell types is also employed by a range of bacteria. One classic example is the endospore forming bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> that can differentiate into dormant and stress-resistant spores to survive harsh environmental conditions (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Setlow, 1995</xref>). Spore formation proceeds via an asymmetric cell division resulting in a small cell, the forespore, and a large mother cell (<xref rid="bib8 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Errington, 2003; Stragier and Losick, 1996</xref>). The two cells follow distinct developmental programs that are kept in register with each other by a tightly coordinated intercellular signaling casade. The corresponding &#x0201c;criss-cross&#x0201d; communication is mediated by the sequential activation of cell-type-specific sigma factors termed &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>F</sup>, &#x003c3;<sup>G</sup>, and &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> (<xref rid="bib19 bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kroos et&#x000a0;al., 1989; Losick and Stragier, 1992</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). The final steps of spore formation are under control of the sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup>, which is synthesized in the mother cell as an inactive, membrane-associated precursor protein (pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup>) that is activated by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe and Kopan, 2004</xref>). In the specialized SpoIV RIP pathway, the I-CLiP intramembrane cleaving protease SpoIVFB (4FB) is embedded in the mother-cell membrane and is held inactive by two membrane proteins SpoIVFA (4FA) and BofA (<xref rid="bib7 bib26 bib28 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Cutting et&#x000a0;al., 1990; Resnekov and Losick, 1998; Rudner et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Rudner and Losick, 2002</xref>). Inhibition of 4FB is relieved by the signaling proteases SpoIVB (4B) and CtpB that are secreted into the intramembrane space and cleave the extracellular domain of the negative regulator 4FA at multiple sites (<xref rid="bib4 bib36" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006; Zhou and Kroos, 2005</xref>). The 4FB membrane protease then processes pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> into the mature &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> transcription factor that, in turn, activates many of the genes required to complete the sporulation program (<xref rid="bib4 bib5 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006, 2007; Pan et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Though the members of this specialized RIP pathway are known, it is still unclear how the distinct proteases cooperate with each other to ensure the precisely timed activation of &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup>.</p><p>The signaling proteases 4B and CtpB belong to the widespread family of PDZ-proteases that combine a catalytic serine protease with a regulatory PDZ domain that is capable of sensing distinct molecular cues, as exemplified by the HtrA proteases (reviewed in <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clausen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to HtrA proteases, the mechanistic features of 4B and CtpB have not been examined, and thus it remains unknown how these signaling proteases are regulated. Whereas 4B belongs to a small clan of bacterial serine proteases of unknown structure, CtpB is a member of the large family of C-terminal processing proteases (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rawlings et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>) that either serve a regulatory role when cutting the C-termini of specific precursor proteins (<xref rid="bib12 bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hara et&#x000a0;al., 1991; Takahashi et&#x000a0;al., 1988</xref>) or a housekeeping function when degrading incompletely synthesized proteins tagged by the SsrA system (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Keiler et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). Structural analysis of the chloroplast D1 degrading protease (D1P) (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Liao et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), a member of this protease family involved in the biogenesis of photosystem II, revealed a Ser-Lys dyad as the catalytic motif but did not elucidate further regulatory properties.</p><p>Given the remarkable versatility of PDZ-proteases acting as sensor proteins in diverse biological processes and the broad impact of RIP cascades for cell-cell communication, it is striking how little is known about the molecular mechanism of C-terminal processing proteases implicated in cellular signaling. To delineate this mechanism, we undertook a comprehensive structural, biochemical, and in&#x000a0;vivo analysis of CtpB from <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>. Here, we present high-resolution crystal structures of CtpB in a resting and multiple active conformations. A prominent feature of the CtpB fold is the sequestration of the catalytic pocket in a narrow tunnel providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed dependency of CtpB protease activity on prior substrate processing. In sum, our data define the molecular underpinnings of how CtpB is regulated and explains how a specialized RIP system ensures the precise temporal control of transcription factor activation that is required for efficient spore formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>The 4B Protease Prepares the 4FA Substrate for CtpB Cleavage</title><p>Previous studies revealed that &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> maturation is under control of the signaling proteases 4B and CtpB that introduce several cuts into the extracellular domain of the 4FA inhibitor. The cleavage sites targeted by 4B (residues 104, 116, 146, and 154) and CtpB (residue 131) (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>) are located in the linker region connecting the compact LytM domain with the transmembrane region of 4FA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). To test whether the two PDZ-proteases cleave the 4FA substrate independently or in concert, we incubated various 4FA constructs with recombinant 4B and CtpB. Owing to autoproteolysis of wild-type CtpB at positions 36 and 42, we performed the biochemical analysis using a truncated protease, which had an activity indistinguishable from the full-length protein (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>A and S1B available online). Consistent with previous work (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>), the model substrate 4FA<sub>EC</sub> that represents the complete extracellular portion of 4FA was efficiently cleaved by both 4B and CtpB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). Because the N terminus of the extracellular 4FA domain is normally anchored in the mother-cell membrane and thus shielded from degradation, we generated a 4FA variant carrying an N-terminal SUMO fusion protein as a steric block. To simplify our analysis, we further mutated all 4B cleavage sites except 154, the primary target site of 4B in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>). Strikingly, CtpB was unable to process the &#x0201c;SUMO-sealed&#x0201d; substrate, whereas 4B efficiently cut the construct into two halves. However, when SUMO-4FA<sub>EC</sub> was incubated with both signaling proteases, the N-terminal cleavage product (4FA<sub>proc</sub>) generated by 4B was rapidly cleaved by CtpB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). This CtpB-dependent cleavage of the preprocessed substrate was &#x0003e;10-fold faster than of the uncut, N-terminally accessible 4FA<sub>EC</sub> substrate.</p><p>To monitor the activities of the proteases with a substrate that more closely mimics the in&#x000a0;vivo situation, we prepared membranes from early sporulating <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> cultures. The strain used (BNC694) carries a deletion of the 4B protease and expresses a functional 4FA transmembrane variant with an N-terminal&#x000a0;GFP fusion. The detergent-solubilized <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> membrane proteins were incubated with CtpB and 4B alone, and the cleavage of 4FA was followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies. Consistent with our previous results, solubilized GFP-4FA was cleaved by 4B, but not by CtpB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). Moreover, treatment with 4B yielded a single cleavage product, resulting from a cut at position 154, even though all 4B cleavage sites were present. This suggests that the 4B protease cleaves the full-length, membrane-embedded substrate differently from the isolated 4FA extracellular domain. Most importantly, the corresponding cleavage product was promptly degraded by CtpB, which was added at a later time point to the reaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D). Taken together, the in&#x000a0;vitro reconstituted cleavage reactions demonstrate that 4B-dependent cleavage of 4FA generates a substrate that can be further digested by CtpB.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>The CtpB Protease Is Organized as a Dimeric Ring</title><p>To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the interplay between the two signaling proteases, we performed a detailed structural analysis of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> CtpB. The crystal structure of the wild-type protease was determined at 1.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution using anomalous diffraction data (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Overall, CtpB is composed of a PDZ domain, two protease subdomains, and two dimerization motifs, which are used to assemble a ring-like dimer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>A). The N-terminal dimerization motif comprises two alpha helices (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2) that form an intermolecular 4-helix bundle upon dimerization. On the opposite side of the CtpB dimer, the C-terminal dimerization motifs folds into two juxtaposed 4-helix domains (&#x003b1;9, &#x003b1;10, &#x003b1;11, &#x003b1;12) that resemble, despite distinct function, the pro-MMP-2 propeptide (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Morgunova et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>) and the peptidoglycan-binding domain of the lytic transglycosylase gp144 (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Fokine et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with the large size of the composite dimer interface (2550&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>), its hydrophobic character, and the participation of highly conserved residues (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>B), the CtpB dimer observed in the crystal is stably formed in solution and is essential for protease function (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1</xref>C and S1D).</p><p>The PDZ domain that protrudes away from the center of the dimer is the most flexible entity of the protein as judged by its thermal motion factors (46.3&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> compared to the average B-factor of 41.5&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>). It adopts a similar fold as other PDZ domains present in a protease context having a highly twisted, five-stranded &#x003b2; sheet (&#x003b2;c, &#x003b2;d, &#x003b2;e, &#x003b2;f, and &#x003b2;g) as the central element. The edges of the sheet are shielded by two helices, &#x003b1;4 and &#x003b1;5, with the longer helix &#x003b1;5 contributing to the peptide-binding cleft next to strand &#x003b2;c. The functional body of CtpB is completed by a bipartite protease scaffold that is composed of a cap and a core subdomain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C). The protease cap forms a roof-like structure on top of the protease core, with one side of the roof being formed by helix &#x003b1;3 and the second side by the 3-stranded sheet &#x003b2;a/&#x003b2;n/&#x003b2;o. The protease core comprises a 4-stranded, largely parallel &#x003b2; sheet (&#x003b2;h, &#x003b2;i, &#x003b2;j, and &#x003b2;m) that winds around helix &#x003b1;13 and is covered on its opposite side by helices &#x003b1;6, &#x003b1;7, and &#x003b1;8. Compared to other C-terminal processing proteases (peptidase family S41) (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Rawlings et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>), CtpB features a 27-residue long insertion after helix &#x003b1;7 that folds into a &#x003b2;-hairpin structure (&#x003b2;k and &#x003b2;l). This insertion protrudes away from the protease core and continues along the cap domain toward the N-terminal dimerization domain of the adjacent protomer, where Arg280 located at the tip of the &#x003b2;k/&#x003b2;l-hairpin closely interacts with helix &#x003b1;2 thus contributing to the CtpB dimer interface (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>The Proteolytic Site of CtpB Is Buried within a Tunnel</title><p>The most remarkable feature of the CtpB structure is a narrow tunnel that is formed between the protease core and the protease cap (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). This tunnel is about 7&#x000a0;&#x000c5; wide and therefore should exclusively allow the passage of an unfolded protein segment present in extended conformation. The tunnel opens toward the peptide-binding cleft of the PDZ domain and sequesters the active site nucleophile (Ser309) required for peptide cleavage (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>). The side chain of Ser309 is in hydrogen bonding distance to Lys334, which could function as an acid-base catalyst during peptide hydrolysis. Lys334, in turn, is oriented by Gln338, a strictly conserved residue in the CtpB family (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>B). Owing to the observed interaction network, we presume that Ser309, Lys334, and Gln338 function as catalytic triad mediating cleavage of the 4FA substrate. Notably, a peptide ligand, which copurified and cocrystallized with CtpB, was observed at the entrance of the protease tunnel near the catalytic triad (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B). The peptide closely interacts with strand &#x003b2;n revealing how the P2, P3, and P4 residues of the substrate are accommodated in specificity pockets formed at the interface of the two protease subdomains.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>The PDZ Domain Controls Access to the Protease Tunnel</title><p>As will be described below, we determined crystal structures of various functional forms of CtpB that recapitulate the enzymatic cycle of the protease. Based on the proper arrangement of the catalytic triad, the structure described above likely reflects the active state of CtpB, which we refer to as CtpBa1. To refine the molecular mechanism of CtpB regulation, we carried out additional crystallization experiments and obtained a crystal form in which CtpB was present in two further active conformations, CtpBa2 and CtpBa3 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). In contrast to CtpBa1, the peptide bound in the proteolytic site of CtpBa2/3 was covalently attached to Ser309 representing a trapped reaction intermediate that depicts the mechanistic properties of CtpB in great detail (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>A). The organization of the active site suggests that binding specificity primarily depends on the P1 and P2 residues preceding the scissile bond. The P1 side chain of the substrate is accommodated in a small, hydrophobic pocket lined with residues Leu257, Ile313, and Val337, whereas the P2 residue protrudes into a slightly larger hydrophobic pocket that is composed of residues from both protease core (Tyr256) and cap (Phe103 and Leu107). Consistent with the structural data, the biochemically identified CtpB cleavage sites have specific residues in P1 (Ala and Val) and P2 (Thr, Leu, and Ile) position but are otherwise diverse (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>B). In addition, structural comparison of CtpBa1/2/3 reveals that protease and dimerization domains are similarly arranged (rms deviation between 0.50&#x02013;0.59&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for 300 C&#x003b1; atoms), whereas the PDZ domains are differently positioned. In CtpBa2 and CtpBa3, the PDZ domains are located further from the proteolytic tunnel compared to CtpBa1, highlighting the pronounced en-bloc mobility of the PDZ domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). Despite this structural flexibility, a common feature of the active protease is the formation of the two-stranded &#x003b2; sheet &#x003b2;b/&#x003b2;g that limits the rotational freedom of the PDZ domain to orient its peptide-binding site toward the opening of the protease tunnel.</p><p>To fully delineate how CtpB is regulated, we determined the high-resolution crystal structure of the resting protease by crystallizing the catalytically inactive S309A mutant. Compared to CtpBa1/2/3, the resting CtpB (CtpBi) assembles a more compact dimer with a remodeled functional core. Interestingly, the PDZ domain was repositioned such that it is closely incorporated into the CtpB scaffold blocking the protease tunnel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C). As a further consequence, the protease cap is shifted away from the protease core leading to the remodeling of the active site. This rearrangement is best seen for Gln338 that pulls the active site Lys334 away from Ser309, thereby disrupting the catalytic triad (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>C). Accordingly, the resting CtpBi is characterized by a disrupted active site and a&#x000a0;blocked enzymatic tunnel. Taken together, the four crystal structures of CtpB represent distinct snapshots of the working CtpB emphasizing the importance of the PDZ domain in gatekeeping the protease tunnel and defining resting and active conformations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Peptide Binding to the PDZ Domain Stimulates Protease Activity</title><p>Having observed different functional conformations of CtpB, we next explored the molecular mechanism underlying the regulatory switch in protease activity. Strikingly, inspection of the ligand-binding sites of the four CtpB structures revealed that the active structures CtpBa1/2/3 had a peptide bound in the PDZ domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A), whereas the corresponding interaction site of CtpBi was empty. The peptide-binding pocket of the PDZ domain is located in the cleft between strand &#x003b2;c and helix &#x003b1;5. One edge of this pocket is composed of the carboxylate-binding loop, which is formed by residues Gly113-Ile114-Gly115-Ala116 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B) and anchors the C terminus of the captured substrate. Although we could not determine the identity of the copurified and cocrystallized peptide by mass spectrometry, the high quality of the CtpBa1 electron density map revealed a proline as the penultimate residue, which is bound together with its adjacent residues as an additional &#x003b2; strand to &#x003b2;c of the PDZ domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). Since proline residues are typically not found in PDZ-binding motifs, we explored the substrate preference of the PDZ domain of CtpB by biochemical means. To this end, we carried out a peptide spot analysis using a polypeptide library presenting 1,849 distinct C termini prepared by an inverted peptide array (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Boisguerin et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A). Peptides recognized by the isolated PDZ domain of CtpB were systematically permutated and tested in secondary screens. The results of these assays indicate that the PDZ domain of CtpB preferentially binds peptides carrying Tyr/Phe/Trp-Ala/Val combinations at their C terminus (Y/F/W-V/A, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>B). To test whether the identified ligands also interact with full-length CtpB, we carried out isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with the proteolytically inactive S309A mutant. The derived dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) for the full-length protein were about 3-fold higher than for the isolated PDZ domain, but still in the range of 2&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M highlighting the potential of the Y/F/W-V/A motif to target substrates to CtpB (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>C). However, when we analyzed the sequences of the 1,864 proteins predicted to reside in the intermembrane space of <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic>, none of the 13 proteins carrying the preferred C-terminal consensus motif appears to be a potential substrate. In all cases, the Y/F/W-V/A C terminus is close to a folded protein segment and thus presumably inaccessible to CtpB (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Given the high affinity of the Y/F/W-V/A motif, it is striking that a peptide with a proline in penultimate position, which was a minor hit in the peptide spot analysis, copurifies with CtpB and stabilizes its active fold. As this peptide was only observed upon overexpressing proteolytically active CtpB, we presume that the copurified ligand was directly generated by CtpB, most likely at rather high concentrations favoring its binding to the PDZ domain. Unfortunately, we could not determine the K<sub>D</sub> of a corresponding peptide due to its weak binding properties. To investigate the interaction with a proline-containing peptide, we thus applied a structural approach and cocrystallized the S309A mutant with an oligopeptide having a Val-Pro-Ala C terminus. The crystal structure of the resultant S309A/VPA complex, which was determined at 1.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution, demonstrated unequivocally that the Val-Pro-Ala motif can specifically bind to the PDZ domain (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>D). In addition, the S309A/VPA structure revealed that peptide binding itself is sufficient to transform the resting protease into the active conformation, even in the absence of the functional OH group of Ser309 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D).</p><p>To test the respective allosteric mechanism biochemically, we carried out degradation assays monitoring how CtpB digests model substrates carrying distinct C termini. Based on the 4FA<sub>proc</sub> substrate resulting from 4B cleavage, we synthesized various model proteins containing the native CtpB cleavage site and variable C termini predicted to having either a high-affinity&#x000a0;(Ala-Tyr-Val), a low-affinity (Ala-Pro-Ala, reflecting the 4B-generated, physiological substrate), or a noncognate (Asp-Ser-Glu) PDZ-targeting tag. Upon incubation with CtpB, we monitored the degradation of the in&#x000a0;vitro translated proteins by autoradiography. In support of our hypothesis that peptide binding is coupled to protease activation, substrates carrying the Ala-Tyr-Val or Ala-Pro-Ala C terminus were rapidly degraded, while the noncognate C terminus strongly inhibited degradation by CtpB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E). Moreover, the low-affinity targeting tag Ala-Pro-Ala was less efficient in stimulating protease function than the Ala-Tyr-Val motif, especially at lower concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F), although the difference was smaller than would be expected from its markedly lower binding affinity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Arg168 of the PDZ Domain Couples Substrate Binding with Protease Activation</title><p>Owing to its residual protease activity against substrates having a noncognate C terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>E), CtpB appears to exist in equilibrium between resting and active conformations. Of note, the PDZ domain of CtpBi is fixed in its inhibitory position by a multitude of specific interactions with residues of the protease cap, the protease core, and the tail domain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>A). The size of this interface (1300&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) corresponds to interface areas observed for transient and stable protein-protein interactions (i.e., 500&#x02013;1500&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) and, importantly, is larger than that observed in the active conformations (e.g., 550&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> in CtpBa1). Therefore, the resting state of CtpB with its &#x0201c;locked&#x0201d; PDZ domain should represent the prevailing conformation in solution. Given this favored domain arrangement, how can the catalytically active conformation be stabilized? Our structural data suggest that Arg168 could function as a key residue controlling the conformational switch (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A). In the resting state, the side chain of Arg168 points away from the PDZ domain forming hydrogen bonds with Ser106 that is located on helix &#x003b1;3 of the protease cap. However, in the activated state, Arg168 is reoriented such that its side chain can directly participate in anchoring the main-chain of the incoming ligand (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). Importantly, Arg168 maintains the contact with helix &#x003b1;3 during the conformational transition, as seen by its interactions with Ser106 or Asp105 in CtpBa1 and CtpBa2/3, respectively. Thus, Arg168 can switch between peptide bound and unbound orientations but maintains the interdomain contact in both states. We therefore propose that Arg168 functions as a substrate sensor stabilizing the active conformation once it is engaged in peptide binding to the PDZ domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B).</p><p>To test this model, we monitored the effects of various CtpB mutations on degrading the 4FA<sub>proc</sub> substrate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). Since Arg168 closely interacts with the protease cap orienting the flexible domain, we first explored to what extent the precise positioning of the protease cap is required for full protease function. For this purpose, we distorted the catalytic triad Ser309-Lys334-Gln338, which contain residues from both protease subdomains. Introducing the Q338E mutation abolished protease function confirming the identity of the composite catalytic triad. Moreover, this result argues that the cap needs to be precisely oriented to establish the fully functional protease. Next, we exchanged Arg168 by Ala and Phe thereby distorting the interface between PDZ domain and protease cap to different degrees. Consistent with the proposed model, the introduced R168A and R168F mutations had two effects. On one side, the mutations led to a 3- to 5-fold weaker affinity for PDZ ligands confirming the involvement of Arg168 in binding the C terminus of the incoming substrate (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>B). In parallel, the mutations reduced the proteolytic activity of CtpB against 4FA<sub>proc</sub> with the R168A mutation having a milder effect than the R168F exchange (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). To specifically monitor the catalytic function of the Arg168 mutants, we generated double mutants coupling the Arg168 variants with a V118Y mutation that completely blocks peptide binding to the PDZ domain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>) but still exhibits residual protease activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). Importantly, the combined R168A/V118Y and R168F/V118Y mutations reduced the protease activity of CtpB to levels lower than the V118Y mutation alone. These results highlight the additional catalytic function of Arg168. To better understand this catalytic role, we crystallized the R168A mutant in the active conformation. As illustrated in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>D, the functional cap and PDZ domains are arranged similarly as in wild-type CtpB; however, both domains displayed elevated thermal motion factors. In particular, helices &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;5, where the interacting Ser106 and Arg168 residues protrude, became more flexible and were slightly relocated. These data indicate that the physical link between PDZ and protease domain, which is established by Arg168, is critical to assemble the fully functional CtpB protease. At last, to directly test the filtering function of the PDZ domain, we monitored protease activity and substrate selectivity of a PDZ deletion mutant (&#x00394;PDZ). Strikingly, the &#x00394;PDZ mutant cleaved the 4FA<sub>proc</sub> substrate more efficiently than wild-type CtpB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). Moreover, the &#x00394;PDZ mutant did not distinguish between substrates having a CtpB-targeting or nontargeting C terminus, as it degraded all substrates with similar efficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E). Thus, the PDZ deletion yields a constitutively active, &#x0201c;open gate&#x0201d; protease. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the repositioning of the PDZ domain upon substrate binding is critical for protease regulation and is communicated via Arg168 to the proteolytic site.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>4B/CtpB-Mediated Removal of 4FA Residues 131&#x02013;154 Induces &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> Maturation</title><p>To explore the cooperation of 4B and CtpB in degrading the RIP inhibitor 4FA in&#x000a0;vivo, we followed the processing of &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> in different <italic>B.&#x000a0;subtilis</italic> strains. For this purpose, bacterial lysates prepared in 30&#x000a0;min intervals after inducing sporulation were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="bib4 bib7 bib24" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006; Cutting et&#x000a0;al., 1990; Pan et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), the 4FB-mediated processing of pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> into &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> started in the wild-type strain about 3.5&#x000a0;hr after inducing sporulation, whereas mutating all 4B cleavage sites delayed pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> processing and consequently reduced spore formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>). Moreover, a CtpB deletion strain showed a delay of 30-60&#x000a0;min in the onset of &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> processing. A similar &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; phenotype was observed in the strain expressing the 4FA<sup>154</sup> variant carrying only the most C-terminal 4B cleavage site (Ala154), the primary target site of 4B in&#x000a0;vivo (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Campo and Rudner, 2006</xref>). To test our model that 4B and CtpB cooperatively degrade 4FA, we generated a combined &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; strain expressing 4FA<sup>154</sup> and lacking the CtpB protease. In agreement with our model, this strain exhibited a synthetic phenotype, as pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> processing was severely impaired. Moreover, spore formation of the &#x00394;CtpB/4FA<sup>154</sup> double mutant was reduced to the same level as for the 4FA variant missing all 4B cleavage sites, whereas strains either lacking CtpB or expressing 4FA<sup>154</sup> were almost indistinguishable from wild-type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>, <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). These findings provide evidence for the close cooperation between 4B and CtpB in&#x000a0;vivo and, in addition, indicate that the removal of the 4FA segment 131-154, either by repeated 4B cleavage or by the concerted 4B-CtpB activities, relieves inhibition of the 4FB RIP protease triggering pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> processing and consequently spore formation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>CtpB Reveals the Mechanistic Versatility of PDZ-Proteases in Signaling Pathways</title><p>In this work we determined the crystal structures of CtpB in different functional states, including one resting and three active conformations. A structure-guided mutational analysis led us to propose a model for how the CtpB protease is activated. The two most striking features of this mechanism comprise a PDZ-gated protease tunnel and the reversible switch between resting and activated protease states in response to peptide binding to the PDZ domain. Phenotypically, this allosteric mechanism is similar to the activation of HtrA proteases (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Clausen et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). Though structurally unrelated, both CtpB and HtrA evolved a functional motif (CtpB: protease cap; HtrA: activation domain) that reorients and completes the active site in response to peptide binding to the PDZ domain (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>A). In the case of HtrA proteins, a particular protease loop (L3) functions as a critical switch element that interacts with the PDZ domain and stabilizes the active protease conformation in the presence of substrate (DegP; <xref rid="bib16 bib17 bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kim et&#x000a0;al., 2011; Krojer et&#x000a0;al., 2008a; Krojer et&#x000a0;al., 2008b</xref>) or allosteric activator (DegS; <xref rid="bib13 bib30 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Hasselblatt et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Sohn and Sauer, 2009; Wilken et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). In CtpB, the activation signal is communicated to the active site by assigning a dual function to the PDZ residue Arg168, which is critical for binding the C terminus of substrate as well as for stabilizing the active protease. Owing to the close collaboration of protease and PDZ domains in setting up the composite CtpB degradation system, the predigested 4FA<sub>proc</sub> can function as substrate as well as allosteric activator. By binding to the PDZ domain of CtpB, 4FA<sub>proc</sub> opens the protease tunnel thus inducing its own degradation. This <italic>cis</italic>-activation mechanism is different from the regulation of other PDZ-proteases that are typically activated in <italic>trans</italic>, as for example stress-signaling peptides activate DegS to cleave the RseA substrate (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the PDZ domain of CtpB controls protease function in a unique way. Whereas activation of HtrA proteases is under control of a disorder-to-order transition, the PDZ domain of the resting CtpB disrupts the proteolytic site in a structurally defined manner blocking the protease tunnel and separating the catalytic residues. Accordingly, the PDZ domain of CtpB appears to function as an enzymatic prodomain that needs to be reoriented before substrates can be cleaved. Coupling the reorientation of the PDZ prodomain with substrate binding ensures that the CtpB signaling protease can be switched on and off depending on the availability of substrate. Moreover, the PDZ-gated protease tunnel enables CtpB to trim the 4FA substrate in a highly specific manner despite the fact that the targeted protein is largely unstructured. Upon recognizing the C terminus of the preprocessed 4FA, the PDZ domain reorients and pulls the downstream cleavage site, which is located 23 residues away, into the protease tunnel where it gets cleaved. Such specific trimming of an unfolded protein is a unique property of the C-terminal processing proteases demanding for sophisticated regulatory measures as seen for CtpB. Importantly, structural comparison with the related D1P protease suggests that the CtpB mechanism may be generally relevant to regulate tail-specific proteases and respective signaling pathways (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>C). Taken together, the present work highlights the convergent evolution of PDZ-proteases to become activated in a reversible but tightly controlled manner by employing PDZ domains as regulatory modules. In this context, the versatile, and strikingly unpredictable, mechanistic role of a PDZ domain when linked to a &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; protease is remarkable. As seen in great detail for CtpB, this multifaceted function includes substrate sensing, active site gatekeeping and conformational switching. Presumably, it is this functional versatility that underlies the prominent role of PDZ-proteases in controlling diverse cell signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>CtpB Assembles the Minimal Version of a Self-Compartmentalizing Protease</title><p>The protease fold of CtpB is directly related to the cage-forming ClpP and tricorn proteases, which function as molecular shredders in bacterial protein quality control. For both cage-forming proteins, the proteolytic sites are buried within a self-compartmentalizing particle, in which substrate filtering is achieved by sophisticated gating mechanisms, i.e., a regulated entrance pore in case of ClpP (<xref rid="bib11 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Gottesman et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>) and a substrate-guiding &#x003b2;-propeller in the tricorn protease (<xref rid="bib2 bib10" ref-type="bibr">Brandstetter et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Goettig et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Our data suggest that CtpB represents a minimal version of a self-compartmentalizing protease that features a narrow tunnel with a built-in substrate filter and a gatekeeping PDZ domain. To identify structural motifs characterizing these distinctly safeguarded proteases, we aligned the active forms of CtpB and ClpP. Even though the two proteases are only distantly related, ClpP and CtpB exhibit conserved mechanistic features including the construction of the oxyanion hole and the substrate specificity pockets (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>C). However, a striking difference relates to the activation of the active site nucleophile. Whereas Ser97 of ClpP is activated by the commonly found Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, Ser309 of CtpB is part of a Ser-Lys-Gln triad. Importantly, the third residue of the respective triads is contributed by different protease segments. In ClpP, the corresponding aspartate is part of a relatively rigid segment protruding from the core &#x003b2; sheet. In contrast, in CtpB, Gln338 originates from an additional domain, the protease cap that undergoes profound conformational rearrangements during the activation process. Accordingly, the active site architecture of ClpP and CtpB seems to reflect the transformation of a rather static protease cage that is controlled by a remote gating mechanism into a flexible protease tunnel, which is composed of distinct domains and can be allosterically controlled by specific molecular cues (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S6</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>Implications for SpoIV RIP Signaling and Cell-Cell Communication Pathways</title><p>The present work clarifies the collaboration of the two signaling proteases CtpB and 4B in the SpoIV sporulation pathway revealing a novel design principle of RIP cascades. Previous studies showed that 4B-deficient strains are incapable of relieving inhibition of the I-CLiP protease 4FB and are blocked in the production of mature &#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> required to complete spore formation (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hoa et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). As these strains express normal levels of the second signaling protease CtpB, it was unclear why CtpB was unable to cleave 4FA and activate pro-&#x003c3;<sup>K</sup> processing. Our data demonstrate that 4B and CtpB closely collaborate in degrading the 4FA inhibitor (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>). The electron density of the copurified ligand bound to the PDZ domain of CtpB is compatible with a Pro-Ala C-terminal motif. Intriguingly, a corresponding C terminus is generated by the 4B protease when cleaving 4FA at&#x000a0;its primary cleavage site. Though the 4FA<sub>proc</sub> C terminus is not the preferred ligand of CtpB in&#x000a0;vitro, protease and cocrystallization assays indicate that the weak affinity of the degradation tag is sufficient to activate CtpB. According to these data, the predigested 4FA<sub>proc</sub> substrate may need to reach a certain level to turn on CtpB activity. Such a mechanism would prevent the premature induction of the sporulation pathway and in parallel preclude the unspecific cleavage of nonnative substrates carrying a similar degradation tag. In conclusion, we propose that 4B and CtpB act sequentially on 4FA with the 4B protease first removing the compact LytM domain and then, and only then, CtpB further cleaves 4FA removing the remaining linker region (residues 131-154). According to our in&#x000a0;vivo data, it is this linker segment that primarily inhibits the I-CLiP protease 4FB and must be removed to continue the SpoIV RIP pathway.</p><p>Why are two signaling proteases involved in degrading the SpoIV regulator protein 4FA? Typically, RIP pathways are linear cascades, in which a site-1 cleavage event sheds an inhibitory ectodomain from the signaling protein and enables the subsequent site-2 cleavage of the very same protein, producing one signaling molecule per cycle (<xref rid="bib3 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Brown et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Wolfe and Kopan, 2004</xref>). In sharp contrast, the RIP cascade initiated by 4B and CtpB leads to a constitutively active membrane protease 4FB, which can target several pro-&#x003c3;<sup>k</sup> molecules and thus functions as a signal amplifier in the SpoIV pathway. The pronounced signaling capacity of the 4FB I-CLiP may thus necessitate a more elaborate control in its activation mechanism. As revealed in this work, this mechanism relies on the concerted activity of two intermembrane proteases that ensure the precise temporal control of transducing an activating signal from forespore to mother cell. In addition, the present SpoIV RIP mechanism illustrates how different activation signals can be integrated into one pathway. Dependent on the origin of the signaling proteases such a mechanism could coordinate either different transcriptional programs within a single cell or, in case where the signaling proteases are secreted from two neighboring cells, link the RIP signal cascade to cell-cell communication coordinating for example developmental programs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Protein Expression and Purification</title><p>Recombinant His-tagged proteins were expressed in <italic>E.&#x000a0;coli</italic> BL21(DE3)pLysS or B834(DE3) (SeMet derivatized proteins), respectively.

Our data indicate that the three participating proteases 4B, CtpB and 4FB act sequentially in the RIP pathway (respective active forms shown in green). Initially, the 4FA regulator is protected from CtpB cleavage by its folded C-terminal domain. Thus, CtpB activity strictly depends on the previous shedding of 4FA by the 4B protease. The truncated 4FA C terminus binds and activates CtpB, which in turn removes the inhibitory 4FA segment indicated in red.

Both proteases are in equilibrium between resting and active conformations, and become stabilized in the active state once their PDZ domains bind an effector peptide. For this purpose, both proteases utilize a similar toolbox including a composite active site architecture that is composed of a protease core and an attached flexible domain (DegS: activation domain; CtpB: protease cap), and a signal sensing component (DegS: loop L3; CtpB: Arg168) that can read the peptide-binding state of the PDZ domain and stabilize the remodeled, functional proteolytic site in the presence of the allosteric activator. An important difference relates to the origin of the activator. In case of CtpB, substrate and activator are identical thus allowing the tight coupling of substrate binding and substrate cleavage. (B) Schematic presentation of the active site architecture of CtpB and ClpP illustrating their self-compartmentalizing character. Owing to the distinct origin of active site residues, CtpB is subject to allosteric regulation, whereas ClpP is remotely regulated by axial pores controlling substrate access to the protease cage. (C) Superposition of the active sites from D1P (blue), CtpBi (gray), CtpBa2 (green) and ClpP (blue) highlighting differences in the active site structure. Structural alignment of the protease cores yielded a root-mean-square deviation of 1.97&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for CtpBa1-D1P, 1.67&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for CtpBi-D1P, 1.94&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for CtpBa1-ClpP and 2.36&#x000a0;&#x000c5; for CtpBi-ClpP. According to these numbers, ClpP aligns better to the active conformation of CtpB. The peptide bound to CtpBa2 is shown as a stick model (pink) and the DFP bound to ClpP in black. The similarly arranged oxyanion hole (red circle) and S1 specificity pocket (black circle) are indicated together with residues of the respective catalytic triads. In contrast to ClpP, D1P aligns better to CtpBi, suggesting that D1P has been crystallized in an inactive conformation. While D1P and related proteases are reported to have a Ser/Lys catalytic diad (<xref rid="bib45 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Keiler and Sauer, 1995; Liao et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>), the similarity to CtpB suggests that the C-terminal processing proteases rather employ a Ser-Lys-Gln catalytic triad. Consistent with this, residue Gln338 is conserved among these proteases. Structural comparison reveals another interesting feature that may be relevant for regulating D1P. In the resting state of D1P, the catalytic Lys397 is captured by Thr168, a residue located next to the peptide-binding site of the PDZ domain. Therefore, peptide binding to the PDZ domain could break the interaction between Thr168 and Lys397 freeing Lys397 to setup a functional catalytic triad. Similarly to CtpB, such a scenario would link PDZ peptide binding with protease activation, however, rely on a different molecular mechanism.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="figs6"/></fig></floats-group></article>
