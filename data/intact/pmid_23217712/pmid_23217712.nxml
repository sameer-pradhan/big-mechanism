T36 phosphorylation triggers displacement of Ydj1, allowing Ssa1 to bind the&#x000a0;G1 cyclin Cln3 and promote its degradation. The stress CDK Pho85 phosphorylates T36 upon nitrogen starvation or pheromone stimulation, destabilizing Cln3 to delay onset of S phase. In turn, the mitotic CDK Cdk1 phosphorylates T36 to block Cln3 accumulation in G2/M.

They bind a range of client proteins, directing key events in their&#x000a0;life cycle from folding to destruction (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Craig and Marszalek, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Meimaridou et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). Hsp70 proteins share an N-terminal ATPase domain, a substrate binding domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain that mediates cochaperone interaction (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</xref>). The budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome encodes four functionally redundant cytosolic Hsp70s, Ssa1&#x02013;4, which differ in expression pattern but are together essential for cell viability (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Newcomb et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The yeast DnaJ-related cochaperones (J-proteins) Ydj1 and Sis1 regulate Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis and client interactions (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brehmer et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, despite partially overlapping functions, only Sis1 is essential (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Caplan and Douglas, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jones et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Among many known functions of yeast Hsp70 and J-domain proteins, a complex role in cell proliferation has been described. One Ssa client is the cyclin Cln3, the yeast homolog of Cyclin D. Cln3 accumulation activates the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) Cdk1 to phosphorylate Whi5. This releases SBF (Swi4-Swi6) and MBF (Swi6-Mbp1) to promote Cln1 and Cln2 cyclin expression, G1 exit, and S phase onset (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">de Bruin et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ferrezuelo et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Sherlock and Rosamond, 1993</xref>). Diverse stress signals, including mating pheromone stimulation and nitrogen starvation can delay G1/S progression by promoting phosphorylation of PEST sequences in Cln3 leading to proteasome-mediated Cln3 degradation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Benanti, 2012</xref>). Significantly, Ssa proteins and Ydj1 are required for normal Cln3 phosphorylation and destruction (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Verg&#x000e9;s et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Yaglom et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Yaglom et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). Unlike other Ssa clients, Cln3 encodes a J-like domain that competes with Ydj1 for binding. As a result, Ssa proteins can sequester accumulating Cln3 on the ER in early G1. Then, Ydj1 displaces Cln3 in late G1, allowing its transit to the nucleus to drive cell cycle progression (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Verg&#x000e9;s et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The mechanism of this switch remains poorly understood.</p><p>A second yeast CDK, Pho85, has a special role in responding to stress signals by targeting multiple survival, morphogenesis, and proliferation pathways (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Carroll and O&#x02019;Shea, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Pho85 cyclins (Pcls) direct the kinase to specific targets, including substrates shared with Cdk1 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mazanka and Weiss, 2010</xref>). Like Cln3, Pcl9 induces Pho85 phosphorylation of Whi5 in early G1 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kung et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>) to promote Cln1/2 and Pcl1 expression. Then, like Cln1/2, Pcl1 targets Pho85 to Sic1 in late G1 (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Nishizawa et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wysocki et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) to release Cdk1-Clb activity in S phase.</p><p>Despite proteomic evidence of extensive Ssa phosphorylation and the recent finding that mutation of putative phosphorylation sites affects essential functions (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Beltrao et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), a regulatory role remains to be established. However, cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of yeast Hsp90 alters chaperone-client interactions, suggesting functional significance (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mollapour et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that Ssa1 can be phosphorylated by Cdk1 or Pho85 on T36, a CDK consensus site conserved across the Hsp70 family. T36 phosphorylation displaces Ydj1 to allow binding of Cln3, leading to its degradation.&#x000a0;By slowing accumulation of Cdk1-Cln3, Ssa1 T36 phosphorylation prevents inactivation of Whi5 and delays onset of&#x000a0;Cln1/2 expression. Establishing a key role for Ssa proteins in cell-cycle arrest in response to cell stress, upon pheromone&#x000a0;stimulation or nitrogen starvation, Pho85 bound to Clg1 and/or Pcl2 targets T36 to block G1/S progression. Notably, CDK-dependent T38 phosphorylation on mammalian Hsc70 similarly regulates Cyclin D1 binding and activity. Our results support a view of Hsp70 chaperones as active regulators of cell division, integrating environmental cues along with cellular events to help make the critical decision in G1 to proliferate or arrest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Cell Proliferation Defects in Ssa1 T36 Mutants</title><p>Global phosphoproteomic analysis has identified 18 phosphorylation sites in Ssa proteins (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Albuquerque et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) but biological significance has yet to be established. Of these phosphosites, only T36 lies within a consensus S/T-P CDK phosphorylation motif. T36 is highly conserved among Hsp70 family proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A) and is situated in the N-terminal domain, proximal to the ATP binding and cochaperone binding region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B), suggesting a potential regulatory role.</p><p>To examine functions of T36 phosphorylation, we used&#x000a0;a yeast strain in which all four <italic>SSA</italic> genes have been deleted and functionally complemented by <italic>SSA1</italic> expressed from&#x000a0;a <italic>URA3-</italic>marked centromeric plasmid (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Jaiswal et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The&#x000a0;strain was transformed with a <italic>LEU2</italic>-marked plasmid bearing either wild-type <italic>SSA1</italic>, the nonphosphorylatable mutant <italic>ssa1-T36A</italic>, or the phosphomimetic mutant <italic>ssa1-T36E</italic>. The <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid was evicted on 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) media to yield strains expressing wild-type Ssa1, Ssa1-T36A (mimic for nonphosphorylated form), or Ssa1-T36E (mimic for phosphorylated form) as the sole Ssa protein in the cell, hereafter referred to as <italic>SSA1</italic>, T36A, and T36E cells. The <italic>SSA1</italic>, T36A, and T36E cells were similarly viable at 30&#x000b0;C, but the T36E mutation conferred impaired growth at 37&#x000b0;C and inviability at 39&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C). Both T36A and T36E cells demonstrated increased sensitivity to incubation at 42&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref> available online).</p><p>We analyzed the effect of T36 mutation on the in&#x000a0;vitro properties of Ssa1. Whereas intrinsic ATPase activity of WT, T36A, and T36E proteins was not significantly altered, nucleotide binding was decreased in both mutants, suggesting an important regulatory role for this site in Ssa1 function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>D).</p><p>To further dissect effects on cell proliferation, we examined the growth of <italic>SSA1</italic>, T36A, and T36E cells as they progressed through the cell cycle. In asynchronous growth, T36E cells attained a larger cell size before exiting G1 compared to <italic>SSA1</italic> or T36A cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>E), suggesting a role for Ssa phosphorylation in delaying S phase onset. Indeed, flow cytometry of cells synchronized in G1 by nitrogen starvation and released into fresh media revealed that while most <italic>SSA1</italic> and T36A cells progressed toward 2N DNA content by 80 to 100&#x000a0;min after release, many T36E cells remained in G1 past 120&#x000a0;min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>F). In turn, when <italic>SSA1</italic>, T36A, and T36E cells were exposed to the peptide mating pheromone &#x003b1;-Factor (&#x003b1;F), T36A cells failed to arrest, unlike <italic>SSA1</italic> or T36E (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>G). To examine Ssa1 T36 phosphorylation in response to &#x003b1;F, we generated strains expressing hexahistidine-tagged WT or T36A as the sole Ssa protein in the cell. The His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>SSA1</italic> and -T36A cells were treated with &#x003b1;F, and His<sub>6</sub>-Ssa1 protein was purified. Immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Thr-Pro antibody (anti-Phos-T-P, specific to consensus CDK phosphosites) demonstrated &#x003b1;F-dependent Ssa1 phosphorylation, absent from T36A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>H). These data suggest that T36 is phosphorylated in response to pheromone stimulation and may have a specific role in G1/S cell cycle control.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Proteomic Analysis of Phosphoregulation of the Ssa1 Interactome</title><p>Toward identifying Ssa1 partners regulated by T36 phosphorylation, we treated the His<sub>6</sub>-<italic>SSA1</italic> and T36A cells with &#x003b1;F, purified the His<sub>6</sub>-Ssa1 interactomes and compared them by isotope-coded tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A).

Among chaperones/cochaperones known to directly bind Ssa1, those displaying the highest ratios were the ribosomal Hsp70 Ssb1, the Hsp110 homologs Sse1 and 2 (Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factors), the J-protein Ydj1, and Hsp26. Of these, Ydj1 has previously been ascribed a key role in G1/S cell cycle regulation (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Yaglom et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Verg&#x000e9;s et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To directly test Ydj1 dissociation upon T36 phosphorylation, we isolated His<sub>6</sub>-WT and T36A proteins from cells treated with &#x003b1;F.

Only Cdk1 isolated from nocodazole-arrested cells and Pho85 purified from nitrogen-starved or &#x003b1;F-stimulated cells were able to phosphorylate Ssa1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B).</p><p>To confirm Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Ssa1 in&#x000a0;vivo, we utilized a yeast strain expressing an analog-sensitive mutant Cdk1, Cdk1-as1 (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). The inhibitor 1-NM-PP1 selectively binds to Cdk1-as1 and inhibits kinase activity within minutes. Cdk1-as1 cells expressing either His<sub>6</sub>-WT or His<sub>6</sub>-T36A were treated with nocodazole in the presence or absence of 1-NM-PP1. Inhibition of Cdk1-Clb kinase activity in&#x000a0;vivo led to&#x000a0;loss of T36 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). Cln3 is a direct substrate for Cdk1, marking it for destruction (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tyers et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). We asked whether Ssa1-Cln3 interaction may be required for Cdk1 to target Cln3 for phosphorylation. HA-Cdk1-Clb complexes were purified from <italic>SSA1</italic>, T36A and T36E cells treated with nocodazole and assessed for ability to phosphorylate recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-Cln3 in&#x000a0;vitro. Suggesting that phosphorylation of Cln3 by Cdk1-Clb does not require Ssa1-Cln3 interaction, Cln3 phosphorylation was similar independent of whether any coprecipitated Ssa1 was WT, T36A, or T36E (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>D).</p><p>To confirm the role of Pho85 in&#x000a0;vivo, we examined Ssa1 phosphorylation and Cln3 accumulation in nitrogen-starved or &#x003b1;F-treated <italic>pho85</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>E; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>A). Much like T36A cells under either condition, T36 phosphorylation was lost and Cln3 was stabilized in <italic>SSA1</italic> cells lacking Pho85. However, expression of T36E in <italic>pho85</italic>&#x00394; triggered degradation of Cln3, placing Pho85 upstream of Ssa1 with regard to Cln3 regulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>F). As expected, lack of Pho85 also abolished the binding of stabilized Cln3 to Ssa1 in nitrogen-starved or &#x003b1;F-treated <italic>SSA1</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>G; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B).</p><p>Removal of the PEST domain stabilizes Cln3 even under conditions such as nitrogen starvation, where Cdk1 activity is low (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gallego et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>), implying that a second kinase may phosphorylate Cln3 to promote degradation. Consistent with a dual role for Pho85 as an Ssa1 and Cln3 kinase, HA-tagged Pho85 purified from nitrogen-starved cells could directly phosphorylate recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-Cln3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>H). Taken together, the results suggest that, (1) both Cdk1 and Pho85 can target Cln3 for destruction via direct phosphorylation of both Ssa1 and Cln3 and, (2) Pho85 activity prevents Cln3 accumulation during nitrogen starvation and &#x003b1;F stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Roles of Ssa Proteins and Pcl Cyclins in Pho85-Dependent Regulation of Cln3</title><p>T36 is conserved among the yeast Ssa proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Thus, we tested whether, like Ssa1, Ssa2, 3, or 4 might serve as alternative Pho85 substrates and similarly associate with Cln3 upon nitrogen starvation. Indeed, isolation of His<sub>6</sub>-Ssa1, 2, 3, or 4 from cells also expressing stabilized Cln3 demonstrated increased Cln3 binding to each Ssa protein after nitrogen starvation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A).</p><p>Like Cdk1 regulation by Clns and Clbs, Pho85 substrate specificity is determined through Pcl cyclin protein binding (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Measday et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Moffat et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). To detect which Pcl(s) might activate Pho85 to phosphorylate the Ssa proteins, we assessed physical interaction between Pcl proteins and Ssa1, 2, 3, and 4 by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Ssa1 associated most strongly with Clg1 and Pcl2 and to a lesser extent Pcl6 and Pcl7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>B). Much like Ssa1, Ssa2, 3, and 4 all interacted strongly with Clg1 and Pcl2 but displayed distinct patterns of binding to other Pcl cyclins. Ssa2 bound to Pcl6 and 8, whereas Ssa3 and 4 only bound to Pcl8, suggesting specificity with respect to interaction with Pho85-cyclin complexes.</p><p>Suggesting that Clg1 and/or Pcl2 may target Pho85 to Ssa proteins as a substrate, His<sub>6</sub>-Ssa1 isolated from cells expressing HA-Clg1 or HA-Pcl2 displayed enhanced binding of Ssa1 to Clg1 and Pcl2 upon low nitrogen stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). In turn, binding of Pho85 to Ssa1 induced by nitrogen starvation was lost in cells lacking both the Clg1 and Pcl2 cyclins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D). Many kinases lose affinity for substrates after their phosphorylation. Further, consistent with a role in T36 phosphorylation, Clg1 and Pcl2 interaction in the two-hybrid assay was strengthened against T36A but decreased by T36E (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). Suggesting roles unrelated to Ssa1 phosphorylation, two-hybrid interactions of Pcl6 and 7 were independent of T36 mutation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). These data suggest that Clg1 and/or Pcl2 may serve as the Pcl proteins that activate Pho85 to bind and phosphorylate Ssa proteins and target Cln3 for degradation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Phosphorylation of Hsc70 Alters Cyclin D1 Binding, Stability, and Cyclin D1-CDK-Mediated Signaling</title><p>Overall, Hsp70 family members are highly conserved.

Cells cotransfected with HA-tagged Cyclin D1<sup>T286A</sup> and HaloTag-Hsc70 WT, T38A, or T38E were assessed for Hsc70-Cyclin D1 association via HaloTag pulldown. Consistent with regulation of Ssa1-Cln3 interactions by T36 phosphorylation in yeast, we observed decreased Cyclin D1<sup>T286A</sup> binding to T38A but increased interaction with T38E, relative to WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A).</p><p>To test whether Hsc70 binding promotes Cyclin D1 degradation, we transfected cells to overexpress HaloTag-Hsc70 WT, T38A, or T38E or empty vector and examined for Cyclin D1 abundance after 72&#x000a0;hr. Although no change was observed in cells transfected with vector, WT, or T38A, Cyclin D1 levels were appreciably lower in cells expressing T38E (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B). CDK4/6-Cyclin D1 complexes phosphorylate the Rb tumor suppressor, a functional homolog of Whi5, on multiple sites, including S780. Using antiphospho-S780 antibody, we measured Rb phosphorylation in lysates from cells expressing HaloTag-Hsc70 WT, T38A, or T38E. Consistent with their decreased Cyclin D1 levels, cells expressing T38E displayed loss of Rb phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>B). Rb phosphorylation permits transcriptional induction of multiple genes including Cyclin A1.

Here, we describe a mode of Hsp70 chaperone regulation mediated by direct phosphorylation, resulting in a dramatic switch in Hsp70-client interactions. Via proteomic analysis of the Ssa1 interactome, we observed a distinct pattern in the association of cochaperones and clients upon Ssa1 T36 phosphorylation. Among cochaperones, phosphorylation of T36 similarly decreased association of the J-protein Ydj1 and the Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factors Sse1 and 2. This is notable, given the complementary roles of J-proteins and Hsp70 NEFs in accelerating Hsp70 ATPase activity (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We do not infer that phosphorylation of T36 simply inactivates Hsp70, insofar as the effect is to decrease binding of the J-protein cochaperone Ydj1 while leaving interaction with&#x000a0;a second J-protein, Sis1, relatively intact. In turn, our data suggest that the reciprocal binding of Ydj1 and the G1 cyclin Cln3 to Ssa1 described by <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Verg&#x000e9;s et&#x000a0;al. (2007)</xref> is mediated by T36 phosphorylation. Exchange of Ydj1 for Cln3 on Ssa proteins has been suggested as the key step that allows Cln3 to leave the ER, transit to the nucleus, and promote G1/S progression, but the switch-like kinetics of the START event do not favor a simple competition model. Our data offer a candidate mechanism underlying the observed Cln3/Ydj1 exchange, but suggest added complexity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>). Preventing the displacement of Ydj1 from Ssa proteins via the T36A mutation allows Cln3 protein to accumulate, much like the phenotype of mutation of the inhibitory J domain of Cln3 as reported by <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Verg&#x000e9;s et&#x000a0;al. (2007)</xref>. In turn, the T36E mutant phenotype indicates that the Cln3 association with phosphorylated Ssa proteins mediates Cln3 destruction.</p><p>Our new data may help resolve the apparently conflicting views of Ydj1 function in prior literature. Although loss of Ydj1 results in decreased Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation of the Cln3 PEST domain and stabilization of Cln3 (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Yaglom et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>), <italic>ydj1</italic>&#x00394; cells are shifted toward G1, a defect suppressed through overexpression of Cln3 (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Verg&#x000e9;s et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The decreased Cln3 phosphorylation and lower Ssa1 T36 phosphorylation in cells lacking Ydj1 may each be explained by a decrease in Cdk1 (and perhaps Pho85) abundance in <italic>ydj1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Mandal et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, in cells lacking Ydj1, the Ssa1-Cln3 interaction becomes constitutive, perhaps limiting Cln3 access to the nucleus, and thereby partially uncoupling PEST domain phosphorylation, Cln3 stability, and Cdk1-Cln3 activity.</p><p>Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of the Cln3 PEST domain required for its degradation may be independent of Ssa1 binding. Bacterially expressed Cln3 can still be phosphorylated in&#x000a0;vitro by Cdk1 purified from T36A cells. Additionally, Cln3 remains stabilized in cells where Cln3-Ssa1 interaction is made constitutive but phosphorylation of Cln3 cannot occur, such as T36E cells expressing Cln3 lacking PEST domains. Irrespective of dependency, we find that phosphorylation of Cln3 and the Cln3-Ssa1 interaction are each necessary but neither individually sufficient for degradation of Cln3.</p><p>A significant constraint on models is that the low abundance of&#x000a0;Cln3 relative to Ssa1 or Ydj1 argues against a simple competition mechanism. We imagine a large pool of Ssa proteins, which may shift dynamically between dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states, depending on cell signals and/or cell cycle progression.</p><p>In turn, whereas the T36E mutation phenocopied a deletion of <italic>CLN3</italic> in several respects, it is striking that the T36A mutation displayed such a subtle phenotype under normal growth conditions. Were CDK-dependent Ssa phosphorylation the sole determinant of Cln3 abundance, we might anticipate that the T36A mutant would phenocopy <italic>CLN3-1</italic>, a hyperstabilized truncation mutant (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tyers et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). Unlike <italic>CLN3-1</italic>, Cln3 protein does not accumulate significantly in T36A under normal growth conditions, but fails to be destabilized under conditions that normally trigger Cln3 degradation. We infer that the nearly normal Cln3 levels in T36A may reflect alternative pathways for Cln3 degradation and/or the action of other mechanisms regulating Cln3 expression and abundance.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>Direct Control of the Cell Cycle by CDKs through Chaperone Phosphorylation</title><p>The CDKs Pho85 and Cdk1 are known to have overlapping substrate specificities and can phosphorylate the same residues in their targets (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kung et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Mazanka and Weiss, 2010</xref>). In the case of Ssa chaperones, we have uncovered a mechanism where a single CDK consensus site on Ssa1, T36, can be phosphorylated by each CDK in response to specific cellular conditions. Thereby, both Cdk1 and Pho85&#x000a0;can promote Cln3 degradation, though under distinct circumstances.</p><p>Cdk1 has long been thought to control Cln3 degradation by direct phosphorylation at multiple sites within the carboxyl-terminal PEST domain (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Tyers et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). Our data offer&#x000a0;a second, indirect role for CDKs in Cln3 stability, mediated by Ssa protein phosphorylation. Significantly, we are able to detect Cdk1-mediated Ssa1 phosphorylation in&#x000a0;vivo only in G2/M and in&#x000a0;vitro only with Cdk1 complexes isolated from nocodazole-arrested cells. One implication is that Cln3 stability and activity may be maintained despite accumulation of Cdk1-Cln1/2 complexes by their inability to phosphorylate Ssa proteins. As such, that T36 is a substrate of Cdk1-Clb cyclin complexes, leading to Cln3 degradation, offers a novel mechanism for differentiating gene expression between G1 and S/G2/M in the yeast cell cycle. In turn, Ssa phosphorylation initiated by Cdk1-Clb complexes may persist through anaphase, so that daughter cells are born in G1 with destabilized Cln3.</p><p>In searching for a CDK that phosphorylates Ssa proteins in G1, we uncovered a role for the stress-activated kinase Pho85 in inhibiting G1/S cell cycle progression. We found that Pho85 can phosphorylate Ssa1 in response to nitrogen starvation or pheromone stimulation, leading to Cln3 degradation and a delay in S&#x000a0;phase onset (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>). We also uncovered an unanticipated role for Pho85 in the direct phosphorylation of Cln3. This may explain how PEST-mediated destruction of Cln3 can still occur in conditions where Cdk1 activity is low, such as nitrogen starvation. This is particularly interesting in light of previously established roles for Pho85 in promoting G1/S progression through direct phosphorylation of Whi5 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) and inhibition of Sic1 (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wysocki et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). Opposing roles for Pho85 kinase have previously been ascribed to association with distinct Pcl cyclin partners. Clg1 and Pcl2 interact with Ssa proteins and appear to be candidates for the Pcls that direct Pho85 to target&#x000a0;Ssa proteins as substrates and delay G1/S progression. Notably, Pcl2 expression is uniquely induced by pheromone stimulation (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Measday et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). By contrast, neither Pcl9, a cyclin that binds Pho85 to promote Whi5 phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Tennyson et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>), nor Pho80, a candidate for the cyclin mediating Sic1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Wysocki et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), appeared to interact with Ssa proteins, consistent with Pcl expression determining whether Pho85 serves as a positive or negative regulator of cell cycle progression. The Ssa1-Pcl6/7 interaction observed is also interesting, particularly as our proteomic analysis revealed a dependence of the interaction of Glc7, a regulator of glycogen accumulation with Ssa1 on T36 phosphorylation. Notably, Pcl6/7 activate Pho85 to regulate glycogen metabolism, via Glc7 (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Huang et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Tan et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Timblin et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>), suggesting further connections between Ssa protein phosphorylation, metabolism, and cell-cycle progression.</p><p>The Ssa1 phosphorylation site T36 is present in each Ssa isoform, suggesting that Ssa1 through 4 may be similarly regulated by CDK phosphorylation. In our studies, although some Pcl cyclins appeared to bind all four isoforms, isoform-specific interactions were also observed between Ssa proteins and Pcls, suggesting both overlapping and distinct functions for isoforms in cell-cycle control.

The second peak of the elution was collected for ATPase assay. Protein purity was more than 99% as determined by SDS/PAGE and Coomassie staining. Protein concentration was measured by absorbance at 280&#x000a0;nm using the calculated extinction coefficient of 18,610 M-1&#x000a0;cm-1 for Ssa1 and its mutants. ATPase activity was measured using a coupled enzymatic assay, where the consumption of NADH was monitored by the absorbance at 340&#x000a0;nm.

T36 phosphorylation triggers Ydj1 dissociation and promotes binding of Cln3, which may be phosphorylated by Pho85 on the PEST domains. Binding to Ssa1 and phosphorylation promote degradation of Cln3, decreasing G1/S cell cycle transcription and prolonging G1. (B) In G2/M phase, Cdk1 activated by Clb cyclins phosphorylates Ssa1, driving exchange of Cln3 for Ydj1, and targets Cln3 PEST domains. Both processes drive Cln3 degradation, preventing accumulation of Cln3 and resetting the cell for the next G1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr7"/></fig><fig id="figs1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;S1</label><caption><p>T36A and T36E Cells Lose Clonogenicity at 42&#x000b0;C Compared to <italic>SSA1</italic>, Related to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref></p><p><italic>SSA1, T36A</italic> and <italic>T36E</italic> cells grown at 30&#x000b0;C in YPD media to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5.
