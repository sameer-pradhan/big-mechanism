Here, we show that the R-SNAREs VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2, which cycle between the plasma membrane and endosomes, bind directly to the ubiquitously expressed, PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>-binding, endocytic clathrin adaptor CALM/PICALM. X-ray crystallography shows that the N-terminal halves of their SNARE motifs bind the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> domain as helices in a manner that mimics SNARE complex formation. Mutation of residues in the CALM:SNARE interface inhibits binding in&#x000a0;vitro and prevents R-SNARE endocytosis in&#x000a0;vivo. Thus, CALM:R-SNARE interactions ensure that R-SNAREs, required for the fusion of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles with endosomes and also for subsequent postendosomal trafficking, are sorted into endocytic vesicles. CALM's role in directing the endocytosis of small R-SNAREs may provide insight into the association of CALM/PICALM mutations with growth retardation, cognitive defects, and Alzheimer's disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p><fig id="dfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; Binding to CALM selects VAMPs 8, 3, and 2 for incorporation into endocytic CCVs &#x025ba; The CALM ANTH domain binds VAMPs and PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> simultaneously &#x025ba; Helical N-terminal halves of VAMP SNARE motifs displace the CALM ANTH final helix &#x025ba; VAMP endocytosis is blocked by mutation of residues in the CALM:SNARE interface</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>CALM recognizes the SNARE motif of small R-SNARE proteins as a sorting signal to direct R-SNARE endocytosis and trafficking to the appropriate intracellular compartment while simultaneously shielding the SNARE motif from inappropriate interactions.

As with all membrane proteins, SNAREs must be positioned in their appropriate cellular location in order to function correctly. In recent years, it has become apparent that the cell possesses mechanisms for transporting SNAREs between its various membranes alongside standard (non-SNARE) cargo. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which the SNAREs VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2 are internalized from the plasma membrane.</p><p>There are at least 38 SNAREs in mammalian cells (<xref rid="bib6 bib24 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Bock et&#x000a0;al., 2001; Hong, 2005; Kloepper et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Most contain a single conserved helical SNARE motif of 60&#x02013;70 residues, although SNAP23, SNAP25, and SNAP29 contain two (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>). N-terminal to their SNARE motifs, most SNAREs have a folded region that varies in length from 100&#x02013;150 residues and is usually either a three helical H<sub>abc</sub> domain or a longin domain (reviewed in <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hong, 2005</xref>). SNARE complexes are formed when four SNARE motifs come together as a tetrameric coiled-coil (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Sutton et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). Three of these SNARE motifs are associated with one membrane and derive from the so-called Q-SNAREs, while the other SNARE motif is provided by an R-SNARE that resides in the membrane that will fuse with the first membrane (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Fasshauer et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). It is this relative orientation of the (Q-) and (R-) SNAREs that draws the two membranes close enough to drive their fusion. The specificity of vesicle:organelle and organelle:organelle fusion arising from the limited combinations of SNAREs that can form complexes can only come about if the localization of SNAREs is itself controlled. For instance, SNAREs must be transported to a given organelle membrane so that they can subsequently be sorted into transport vesicles and tubules leaving that membrane since this enables these transport vesicles/tubules to fuse, ultimately, with their desired target membrane, into which the correct cognate SNAREs must have already been placed.</p><p>The active sorting of SNAREs into transport vesicles/tubules is achieved primarily by direct interaction with components of the vesicle/tubule's protein coat, although transmembrane helix length may also play a role (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sharpe et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Initial mechanistic descriptions of active SNARE sorting came from studies on COPII coated vesicles, which mediate ER to Golgi transport (<xref rid="bib33 bib39" ref-type="bibr">Mancias and Goldberg, 2007; Mossessova et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). In post-Golgi trafficking, the sorting of Vti1b by EpsinR (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and of VAMP7 by Hrb (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Pryor et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) and AP3 (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Arca et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>) are mediated by the direct interactions of the folded N-terminal domains of the SNAREs with the respective coated vesicle adaptors. Since the molecular mechanisms by which these latter recognition events occur are distinct from those by which conventional short, linear motif (Yxx&#x003a6;, ExxxLL, FxNPxY) containing cargo are recognized (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>), the two systems are noncompetitive and so can act in parallel to ensure that both SNAREs and cargo are incorporated into transport vesicles.</p><p>VAMP8 and VAMP3 cycle between the cell's limiting membrane and early endosomes/recycling endosomes and thus mediate the fusion of vesicles with both compartments, whereas VAMP2 drives the fusion of fast-recycling synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="bib3 bib20 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Antonin et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Grote et&#x000a0;al., 1995; McMahon et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). None of these three SNAREs have a conventional cargo motif (such as the ExxxLL motif found on VAMP4 [<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Peden et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>]), nor do they possess folded N-terminal domains. However, preceeding their SNARE motifs there are short regions of 10&#x02013;30 residues that are predicted to be unstructured (<xref rid="bib14 bib17 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Ellena et&#x000a0;al., 2009; Fiebig et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Hazzard et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). The question thus arises: how are these SNAREs sorted into endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles? Based on the observations that both Vti1b and VAMP7 can be transported as part of a cis-SNARE complex (<xref rid="bib37 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Miller et&#x000a0;al., 2007; Pryor et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), one possibility was that VAMPs 8, 3, and 2 could be internalized as a complex with their acceptor (Q-) SNAREs (a syntaxin and a SNAP) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). However, endocytic and synaptic vesicles contain a large excess of these small R-SNAREs over their acceptor (Q-) SNAREs (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Takamori et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>) and in addition, the steady state localization of VAMPs 8, 3, and 2 is endosomal, whereas that of syntaxins1-4 and SNAPs is at the plasma membrane. Together, these observations suggest that trafficking of small R-SNARE VAMPs as part of a complex is unlikely.</p><p>In this study, we provide structural, biochemical and in&#x000a0;vivo data to show that the internalization of VAMP8, and consequently that of the highly related small R-SNAREs, VAMP3 and VAMP2, is mediated by specific, direct interactions between the N-terminal halves of their SNARE motifs and the ANTH (AP180 N-terminal Homology) domain of the endocytic clathrin adaptor CALM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>CALM Is Involved in the Endocytosis of VAMPs 2, 3, and 8</title><p>Recent in&#x000a0;vivo studies (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Harel et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) suggested that the ubiquitously expressed CALM and possibly its neuronal specific homolog AP180 (<xref rid="bib13 bib32 bib52" ref-type="bibr">Dreyling et&#x000a0;al., 1996; Lindner and Ungewickell, 1992; Yao et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), may play a role in the trafficking of VAMP2 in mammalian cells. This supported earlier work in <italic>D.&#x000a0;melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bao et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>), <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Nonet et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>), and yeast (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Burston et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that these organisms' single ANTH domain containing clathrin adaptor proteins were involved in the endocytosis of short endocytic R-SNARE VAMPs.</p><p>To confirm a role for CALM in the trafficking of VAMP2 and to show that CALM was similarly involved in endocytosis of the related small endocytic R-SNAREs VAMP3 and VAMP8 (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hong, 2005</xref>), we investigated the effect of CALM depletion on VAMP2, VAMP3, and VAMP8 endocytosis. The three SNAREs were tagged with a double HA epitope at their (lumenal) C-termini (termed VAMP2-HA, VAMP3-HA, and VAMP8-HA) (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) and were stably expressed in HeLa cells at relatively low levels (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A available online). Depletion of CALM by siRNA caused all three SNAREs to accumulate on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). To investigate the rate of endocytosis of the three HA-tagged VAMPs, we used a flow cytometry-based antibody uptake assay (as outlined in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B). In control cells, the three SNAREs were rapidly internalized, with 40%&#x02013;60% of the prebound antibody already inside the cells after 5&#x000a0;min. However, when CALM was depleted, antibody uptake was negligible even after 30&#x000a0;min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>). These effects are considerably more dramatic than previously reported (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Harel et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), presumably because we expressed the constructs at lower than endogenous levels so as not to saturate the intracellular sorting machinery. The inhibition of VAMP endocytosis was rescued by expression of Myc-tagged, full-length, siRNA-resistant CALM, indicating that the phenotype is specific and not an off-target effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C). In agreement with&#x000a0;previous studies (<xref rid="bib21 bib25" ref-type="bibr">Harel et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Huang et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), the endocytosis rates of standard cargoes such as EGF and TfR were not significantly altered by CALM depletion (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>VAMPs 2, 3, and 8 Bind Directly to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub></title><p>To investigate the possibility of a direct interaction between any of these small R-SNAREs and the ANTH domain of CALM (defined as residues 19&#x02013;289 [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ford et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>]), we carried out &#x0201c;GST pull-down&#x0201d; binding assays using recombinantly expressed proteins. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A the three SNAREs interacted directly with the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> domain in a concentration-dependent manner. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to quantify the strength of binding. The interaction between GST-VAMP8 and CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> is the tightest with a K<sub>D</sub> of &#x0223c;18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B), which is typical for a dynamic cargo/coat interaction (<xref rid="bib41 bib43" ref-type="bibr">Owen et&#x000a0;al., 2004; Pryor et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Binding of the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> domain to GST-VAMP3 and GST-VAMP2, although similar to one another (&#x0223c;46&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M and &#x0223c;43&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M respectively), were weaker than the binding to VAMP8 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). These differences in affinities are reflected in the relative rates of endocytosis of the three VAMPs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B). No interaction could be detected between any of the three R-SNAREs and the related ENTH domain of the endocytic clathrin adaptor, epsin1.</p><p>The ANTH domains of CALM and neuronal specific AP180 share 82% sequence identity. However, in our hands, the ANTH domain of mammalian AP180 showed no significantly measurable binding to mammalian VAMPs 2, 3, or 8 by GST pull-downs or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A and S2B), despite being correctly folded as indicated by circular dichroism (CD) (data not shown) and being competent to bind PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> similarly to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> by ITC (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>C) and liposome-based SPR (data not shown). We have no simple explanation for this, but note that AP180 and CALM are not functionally redundant (<xref rid="bib11 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Bushlin et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Harel et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>) and that the single ANTH domain containing clathrin adaptor in lower organisms is more like CALM than AP180 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Harel et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Taken together with the in&#x000a0;vivo studies published by others and presented here, our biochemical data point to the direct binding of the VAMPs 2, 3, and 8 by CALM being directly responsible for the endocytosis of these small R-SNAREs. Hence, we set out to investigate the molecular basis for this interaction using a combination of structure determination and in&#x000a0;vitro and in&#x000a0;vivo assays using wild-type and structure-directed mutant versions of both proteins. Because their sequence similarities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A) and similar binding affinities indicated a conserved mechanism of interaction for the three SNARES, for technical reasons we characterized at the structural level only the interaction between CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> and the R-SNARE to which it bound most tightly, VAMP8.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>The N-Terminal Half of the VAMP8 SNARE Motif Binds to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub></title><p>In order to delineate which portion of VAMP8 binds to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>, a number of deletion constructs were made (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>B), an approach we deemed acceptable since several studies (<xref rid="bib15 bib17 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Fasshauer et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Fiebig et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Hazzard et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>) have shown small VAMPs to have no secondary structure in solution. GST pull-down experiments using truncated versions of VAMP8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>C) revealed that the minimal region necessary for binding was residues 10-41 i.e., the N-terminal half of the SNARE motif. ITC showed that the binding of residues 10-41 of VAMP8 was almost identical (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0223c;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) to that of wild-type VAMP8 (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0223c;18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D), indicating that all the determinants for CALM binding are contained within residues 10-41. Significantly, the corresponding regions of mammalian VAMP2 and of the yeast endocytic VAMP Snc1p contains two key residues, Val43 and Met46 (VAMP2 numbering), which, when mutated to alanines, blocks their endocytosis (<xref rid="bib20 bib31" ref-type="bibr">Grote et&#x000a0;al., 1995; Lewis et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). In agreement with these data, we found that mutation of these residues to alanines in VAMP2-HA and likewise of the analogous residues in VAMP3-HA (Val30 and Met33) and VAMP8-HA (Lys24 and Met27) blocked their internalisation from the cell surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>The VAMP8 SNARE Motif Binds in Place of the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> Final Helix</title><p>Attempts were made to crystallize a complex of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> with a peptide corresponding to residues 10&#x02013;41 of VAMP8, both with the two components free in solution and with residues 10&#x02013;41 of VAMP8 appended on the C terminus of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>. While these cocrystallizations did not yield the structure of a complex, they did yield a 1.8&#x000c5; resolution structure (final R/R<sub>free</sub> 0.182/0.216; see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) of the unliganded ANTH domain with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In both molecules the positions of the first ten helices are identical. The C-terminal 25 residues of the ANTH domain were poorly ordered in one molecule of the asymmetric unit, as in the published CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> structure determined from crystals of a different spacegroup (1HF8; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ford et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>), while in the other molecule the C terminus was constrained by crystal packing and formed a four-turn helix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures&#x000a0;4</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>A). The CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> structures presented here in conjunction with the previously published structure (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Ford et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) suggested that residues 265&#x02013;289 of CALM are not integral to the ANTH domain but are flexible and associate only weakly with the domain's core residues (19&#x02013;264). Inspection of the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> surface showed that the elongated patch on which the ordered short helix 11 and preceding ten residues of CALM sat was hydrophobic in nature and of the correct dimensions to bind an &#x003b1; helix and was thus a good candidate for the interaction site for the hydrophobic SNARE motif of a VAMP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). If this hydrophobic trough were indeed the VAMP binding site on CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>, then deletion of helix 11 would be expected to increase VAMP8 binding. However, a truncated CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> construct missing helix 11 and the preceding ten residues, termed CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub>, unexpectedly showed no binding to VAMP8 by GST pull-down experiments and ITC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>C and 4D) while still displaying normal binding to PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> containing liposomes by SPR (data not shown). Multiangle light scattering (MALS) indicated that in solution CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub> is in fact a tight dimer (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>B). This was confirmed by the determination of the structure of CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub> at 1.7&#x000c5; resolution (final R/R<sub>free</sub> 0.170/0.191; see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). The dimeric structure explained the lack of VAMP8 binding since the dimer interface (burying 2100&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of accessible surface area in total (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>)) was the proposed VAMP8 binding site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>E and 4F). As there were no other significant changes between the surfaces of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> and CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub>, these data strongly indicated that the hydrophobic trough in which helix 11 (when formed) sits was indeed the VAMP8 binding site on CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Structure of a CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub>: VAMP8<sub>(11-41)</sub> Chimeric Complex</title><p>In an attempt to obtain a structure of a complex between CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> and VAMP8, a construct was designed in which residues 11&#x02013;41 of VAMP8 were fused through an artificial linker of six residues to residues 1&#x02013;264 of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>. The resulting chimeric protein (CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub>:VAMP8<sub>(11-41)</sub>) crystallized and its 2.0&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution structure (final R/R<sub>free</sub> 0.183/0.199; see <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>) showed unambiguously (<xref rid="fig5 fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 5 and 6</xref>) that residues 15&#x02013;38 of VAMP8 form a single &#x003b1; helix with residues between Phe16 and Arg37 contacting CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>, consistent with the truncation data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>). The VAMP8 helix fitted into the spatially complementary groove of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>, lined by residues from helix 9 and helix 10, which was blocked by helix 11 in the unliganded CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> structures and by dimerization in CALM<sub>ANTH(1-264)</sub>. There was a small movement of helices 9 and 10 with respect to each other that caused a slight widening of the groove as compared with the unliganded domain structure (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). No electron density was visible for 17 residues that connect the last ordered residue of CALM with the first of VAMP8. This would allow considerable flexibility in the positioning of the VAMP8 and indeed in the crystals where it bound to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> a VAMP8 SNARE motif could reach an adjacent ANTH domain to which it was not covalently linked.</p><p>Key residues in the interaction, 13 on VAMP8 and 16 on CALM, are spread throughout the interface between the two proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>). This shows that the binding is not a short, linear motif-mediated interaction that is typical of standard adaptor/cargo interactions. Eleven of the thirteen key interacting residues are conserved between VAMPs 8, 3, and 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A), suggesting that they bind CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> in a similar manner. The residues in the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>:VAMP8 interface are highly conserved from human to fish. The interface is mainly hydrophobic in nature, burying a total of 1500&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of accessible surface area (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>), and a full list of interacting residues is given in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D. The residues Lys24 and Met27 of VAMP8 play key roles in the interaction, explaining their initial identification as residues of importance for VAMP endocytosis (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Grote et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>) (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lewis et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>).

The single Met27Ala mutation when introduced into VAMP8 abolished the VAMP8:CALM interaction, whereas the Lys24Ala mutation on its own only weakened the interaction. The latter is to be expected since in VAMP2 and VAMP3, which also bind directly to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> albeit&#x000a0;more weakly, the equivalent residues are valines. When transferred to the in&#x000a0;vivo situation, the non-CALM binding Lys24AlaMet27Ala mutant of VAMP8 accumulated on the cell surface and failed to be internalized (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>H and 6I).</p><p>GST pull-down experiments demonstrated that mutation of hydrophobic residues in CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> that participate in VAMP8 binding, Leu219Ser, Phe240Ala, Met244Lys, Ile247Asp, and Leu251Ser, all abolished the interaction between the two proteins in&#x000a0;vitro (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C) without affecting the fold (as judged by expression levels and circular dichroism, data not shown). Two of these, Leu219Ser and Met244Lys, whose lack of binding was confirmed by ITC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C), were introduced into myc-tagged, siRNA-resistant CALM. When transfected into cells expressing VAMP8HA, depletion of endogenous CALM by siRNA caused the SNARE to be retained at the plasma membrane, because it could no longer be internalized (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>F and 6G). This is in contrast to cells transfected with wild-type myc-tagged siRNA-resistant CALM, which retained the ability to internalize VAMP8HA upon endogenous CALM depletion (Figures <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F and 6G, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>C). When taken together, the data presented in this study demonstrate that VAMP8 and the similar small R-SNAREs VAMP3 and VAMP2 are internalized from the plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis due to a direct interaction with the clathrin adaptor CALM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>SNARE Complex Formation and Binding by CALM Are Mutually Exclusive Processes for VAMP8</title><p>Superposing the structure of the N-terminal half of the VAMP8 SNARE motif with the same portion of VAMP8 from the SNARE complex formed from VAMP8, Syntaxin7, Syntaxin8, and Vti1b (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Antonin et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>) demonstrates that, not only does VAMP8 adopt the same gently curving conformation in both complexes, but when the complex structures are overlayed via the VAMP8 molecules they contain, helices 9 and 10 of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> superimpose on the SNARE motifs of Syntaxin8 and Syntaxin7, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). Comparison of the two complex structures thus demonstrates that CALM binding and SNARE complex formation by VAMP8 must be mutually exclusive processes. This is confirmed by recombinant protein binding experiments, which show that GST-VAMP8 binds CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>, but GST-VAMP8 complexed with SNAP23 and syntaxin3 (residues 195&#x02013;253) does not (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B). It is important to note that the Lys24AlaMet27Ala, non-CALM binding mutant of VAMP8 cannot be internalized but, as we show in this work, is able to form SNARE complexes with its cognate plasma membrane SNARE partners. These observations show that, contrary to a previous proposal (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>), the ability of short R-SNAREs to form SNARE complexes and the ability to be endocytosed must in fact be independent of each other.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> Binds VAMP8 and PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> Simultaneously</title><p>Since the binding sites on CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> for PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> and a VAMP are on opposite ends of the ANTH domain, it is probable that both sites could bind simultaneously to their ligands. If this were indeed the case, avidity effects would result in greatly increased binding of CALM to a membrane containing both ligands when compared to the binding to membranes containing only one of the ligands, i.e., the K<sub>D</sub> of the apparent binding to liposomes containing both ligands would be much lower than the average value of the individual K<sub>D</sub>s for the two ligands measured separately. To investigate whether or not simultaneous PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> and VAMP binding does indeed occur, the binding of CALM to liposomes containing PC/PE/PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>, PC/PE+VAMP8 and PC/PE/PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>+VAMP8 was compared using liposome-based SPR. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>C shows that indeed there is an almost order of magnitude decrease in K<sub>D</sub> (i.e., increase in apparent affinity) over the average of the K<sub>D</sub>s for the individual ligands when both ligands are present in the same liposome membrane. Thus CALM must be able to bind simultaneously to PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> and VAMP8.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>Conformation of Membrane-Embedded VAMPs when Bound to CALM</title><p>Given that CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> can bind PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> and a small R-SNARE VAMP simultaneously and based on the structural identification of the binding sites for a VAMP and PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>, the following deductions can be made. To allow simultaneous binding to a membrane-embedded VAMP and PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> to occur, the amino-terminal half of the VAMP SNARE motif must be able to reach its binding site, which is at a distance of around 50&#x000c5; from the membrane surface. Thus, the 38 residues between the end of the CALM binding sequence and the start of the transmembrane helix of a VAMP8 molecule must be able to stretch at least this far. The published NMR and CD studies and our own CD measurements (data not shown) indicate that in fact the entire cytoplasmic domain of short VAMPs has no secondary structure in solution (<xref rid="bib15 bib17 bib23" ref-type="bibr">Fasshauer et&#x000a0;al., 1997; Fiebig et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Hazzard et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). In such an unstructured conformation, the relevant portion of the VAMP's cytoplasmic domain could stretch up to 130&#x000c5;. This is easily sufficient to allow a single CALM molecule, to simultaneously bind a VAMP8 molecule and a PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> molecule from the same membrane.</p><p>In support of this model in which most or all of the portion of small R-SNARE VAMPs between their CALM binding helices and their transmembrane helices is unstructured, insertion of helix-disrupting proline residues in the predicted unstructured C-terminal half of the SNARE motif at positions Leu44 and Leu51 of VAMP8 does not inhibit its ability to bind CALM or to be endocytosed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7</xref>D&#x02013;7F and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). It does, however, prevent SNARE complex formation with SNAP23 and Syntaxin3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B), which relies on the VAMP being able to form a helix over the entire length of its SNARE motif. In contrast, introducing proline residues at positions Leu16 and Val23 in the CALM binding helix of VAMP8 blocks the interaction between the two proteins and prevents VAMP8 endocytosis as well as SNARE complex formation. These observations also are in line with the assertion made earlier that SNARE complex formation and the ability to be endocytosed are not linked, which disagrees with the interpretation of data in (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The endocytic vesicles in most cells must incorporate the R-SNAREs that will allow them to fuse with their target endosome (likely VAMP8 and VAMP3 [<xref rid="bib3 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Antonin et&#x000a0;al., 2000; McMahon et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>]). Alternatively, if they are to undergo immediate recycling without passing through an endosomal compartment, as has been proposed for neuronal synaptic vesicles, the vesicles need to be able to fuse with the plasma membrane, for which it is believed they use VAMP2 (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Grote et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>). Vesicles destined for endosomes must also return any SNAREs that have previously been used for fusion with the plasma membrane for reuse in subsequent vesicle/organelle fusion events. Such SNAREs include VAMP3 and VAMP8 for recycling back to the plasma membrane; VAMP7 and VAMP8 for endosome/lysosome biogenesis (<xref rid="bib1 bib3 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Advani et&#x000a0;al., 1998; Antonin et&#x000a0;al., 2000; Pryor et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>); VAMP8, VAMP7 and VAMP2 for the regulated secretion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane (reviewed in <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chaineau et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>); and VAMP4 for TGN-to-endosome transport (<xref rid="bib47 bib50" ref-type="bibr">Steegmaier et&#x000a0;al., 1999; Tran et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>).

Transport in an inactive form prevents erroneous VAMP7-mediated fusion of endocytic vesicles with degradative late endosomes and lysosomes.</p><p>In contrast, we demonstrate that VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2, which are required for the fusion of endocytic vesicles with their target early endosomes, are endocytosed in an uncomplexed and therefore essentially active form through their interaction with CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>. However, since binding to CALM and participation in SNARE complexes are mutually exclusive processes, as both binding events utilize the same face of the VAMP, it would be more correct to state that VAMPs 8, 3, and 2 are endocytosed in only a potentially active form, as their conserved SNARE motifs are shielded by being bound to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>. Corecognition of PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> markedly increases the strength of binding between CALM and a membrane containing both a small R-SNARE VAMP and PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>. In order for a small R-SNARE VAMP to bind to CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>, helix 11 of the ANTH domain must be displaced. This dissociation will be facilitated by the fact that helix11 is only poorly associated with the rest of the ANTH domain (helices 1&#x02013;10) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>) and may be further modulated by the C-terminal tail of CALM that follows helix11 binding to the clathrin terminal domains that are displayed on the underside of the polymeric clathrin lattice (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Morgan et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). It should be noted that despite it being necessary to truncate CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> at residue 264 in order to obtain the structure of the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>:VAMP8 complex, the displacement of helix11 must have occurred in our biochemical assays as all were performed on residues 1&#x02013;289 of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub>.</p><p>Following scission of an endocytic clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV), the vesicle will uncoat by processes that include PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis and clathrin cage disassembly. Once PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> is hydrolyzed, the avidity effect generated by a single CALM molecule simultaneously binding PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> and a small R-SNARE VAMP will vanish leaving only the weak, transient R-SNARE:CALM interaction. The two proteins will therefore quickly dissociate. In order to minimise the energetically unfavorable situation of the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic helix being exposed to the aqueous environment, the N-terminal half of the SNARE motif of the short R-SNAREs, while still remaining as a helix, switches to lying on the surface of the vesicle membrane (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Ellena et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). In the case of other SNAREs such as the syntaxins and longin domain SNAREs, the SNARE motifs can be shielded from the aqueous environment by binding back on their N-terminal regulatory domains, which are not present in the small R-SNAREs. On reaching its final destination, the VAMP will now form tight, energetically favorable complexes with its cognate Q-SNAREs on an endosome and so drive fusion between the endocytic vesicle and endosomal membranes. Thus in the cell, the SNARE motif of a small R-SNARE is never free but interacts with either CALM, a membrane surface or is part of a cognate SNARE complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>G).</p><p>Nonsense point mutations in CALM are responsible for hematopoietic and iron metabolism abnormalities, growth retardation, and shortened life span in fit1 mice (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Klebig et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), the strongest phenotypes resulting from premature translational termination in the CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> domain. The CALM/PICALM gene has also been directly implicated in alterations in cognitive function with increasing age (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Mengel-From et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>) in risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Harold et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) and in modifying the toxicity of A&#x003b2; in a yeast, <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> and primary rat cortical neuron models (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Treusch et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). These pathophysiological effects could, until now, only be explained by the role of CALM in linking clathrin to the PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>-containing membrane during endocytosis, a role replicated by all clathrin adaptors. The work presented here raises the possibility that such effects are related to CALM's ability to directly drive the endocytosis of the small R-SNAREs VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2, since failure to correctly transport these small R-SNARE VAMPs to early endosomes as a result of a reduction in CALM levels would perturb subsequent trafficking of a wide variety of proteins through the endocytic pathway. In the case of Alzheimer's especially it appears that any alterations in vesicle trafficking give rise to increased levels of A&#x003b2; production, presumably by modifying the localization of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or that of its processing proteases (&#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3; secretases) (<xref rid="bib9 bib30 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Burgos et&#x000a0;al., 2010; Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2008; Sannerud and Annaert, 2009</xref>). Further, it has been documented that a major pathway for clearance of A&#x000df; from the brain parenchyma is endocytosis by various cell types including astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. The latter may further mediate A&#x000df; clearance from the brain through the blood-brain-barrier by transcytosis, and it is of note that these cells were shown to possess the highest levels of CALM expression in the brain (<xref rid="bib4 bib8" ref-type="bibr">Baig et&#x000a0;al., 2010; Bu, 2009</xref>). This provides another possible explanation for why CALM has been linked to risk of Alzheimer's disease since CALM should play a key role in this endocytic process by selecting the R-SNAREs needed both for endocytic vesicle/endosome fusion and for subsequent fusion events along the endocytic pathway.</p><p>In summary, we have provided insight into the molecular mechanism by which the post-Golgi small R-SNAREs bind specifically to the ubiquitously and highly expressed endocytic clathrin adaptor CALM, recently confirmed in <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Koo et&#x000a0;al. (2011)</xref>. This ensures that the SNAREs required for fusion with the endosomal system and for subsequent trafficking steps are actively selected into endocytic CCVs. This ability to mediate the endocytosis of small R-SNARE VAMPs from the cell's limiting membrane provides a possible explanation for the association of CALM with a variety of both neurological and other disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec4"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><p>For a list of the constructs and full materials and methods used in this study, please see the <xref rid="dtbox1" ref-type="boxed-text">Extended Experimental Procedures</xref>.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Cell Biology</title><p>HeLaM cells were used for all experiments.

Binding experiments were carried out at 4&#x000b0;C overnight with constant agitation. The supernatants were removed and the beads were washed three times with 1&#x000a0;ml of buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used at 1:5000, followed by Rabbit anti Mouse HRP used at 1:8000. For testing the binding to SNARE complexes, the complexes were first formed and purified in isolation before being used in binding assays. SNAP23 and syntaxin3 were themselves made by cleaving the proteins from their N-terminal GST-fusion proteins with thrombin while they were bound to glutathione sepharose beads at 25&#x000b0;C for 2&#x000a0;hr. The cleaved proteins were eluted from beads and the thrombin inactivated by the addition of ABESF. SNARE complexes containing GST-VAMP8, were made by incubating GST-VAMP8 with a three fold molar excess of SNAP23 and syntaxin3 at 4&#x000b0;C for 48&#x000a0;hr with constant agitation in 20&#x000a0;mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 500&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 4&#x000a0;mM DTT, 0.5% NP-40.

All proteins were purified by S200 gel filtration into 100&#x000a0;mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150&#x000a0;mM NaCl, 4&#x000a0;mM DTT. SNAREs were used while still attached to GST to improve solubility. 1.4&#x000a0;ml of GST-SNARE (WT or mutant) was placed into the cell at 0.15&#x000a0;mM.

The heat of dilution of CALM<sub>ANTH</sub> or Epsin<sub>ENTH</sub> into buffer was subtracted from the relevant data and the titration curves were fitted using ORIGIN software, yielding values for the stoichiometry n, equilibrium association constant K<sub>A</sub> (= K<sub>D</sub><sup>-1</sup>) and enthalpy of binding. All experiments were carried out at least three times and K<sub>D</sub>s quoted in the text are the average of all runs.

The details of liposome generation, their immobilization on the L1 chip and the subsequent binding are described elsewhere (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). In brief, we used liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at a ratio of 80%&#x000a0;+ 20% as controls. PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> and 18:1 DGS-NTA(Ni) lipid were used at 5% at the expense of PC. Liposomes were captured on the L1 surface during 5&#x000a0;min injections at a flow rate of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min. Typically the four flow cells (FCs) of the L1 chip were derivatized with following set of liposomes: PC/PE on FC1, PC/PE+ 5% PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub> on FC2, PC/PE+5% DGS-NTA(Ni) on FC3 and PC/PE+ 5% PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>+5% DGS-NTA(Ni) on FC4. To verify that liposomes on flow cells 2 and 4 contained equal amounts of PtdIns4,5P<sub>2</sub>, the levels of Epsin1<sub>ENTH</sub> domain binding were monitored. The differences between the flow cells (R<sub>max</sub> values) were less than 4%. After liposome capture, the surface was stabilized by two pulse injections with 50&#x000a0;mM NaOH for 10&#x000a0;s at 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min. The flow rate was set to 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min followed by injection of His-tagged VAMP8 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) for 6&#x000a0;min, which resulted in 600RU of captured protein on the two flow cells with the DGS-NTA(Ni) lipid. Subsequently, we monitored the binding of CALM, using one minute injections at 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min and concentrations between 10&#x000a0;nM and 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M. The kinetic parameters were calculated after background subtraction (binding to PC/PE liposomes) exactly as described (<xref rid="bib61 bib62 bib63" ref-type="bibr">Honing et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Jackson et&#x000a0;al., 2010; Kelly et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). The absolute values of K<sub>D</sub>s obtained for binding to the individual ligands obtained by this method are around an order of magnitude lower (tighter binding) than those obtained for the same ligands in solution by ITC. This likely reflects the fact that in liposome-based SPR the ligands are effectively concentrated on a two dimensional surface rather than in solution, a situation that is more representative of the physiological situation. In this work we do not compare measurements obtained using ITC and liposome-based SPR but only compare K<sub>D</sub> values obtained using a single technique.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.13"><title>Multiangle Light Scattering Experiments</title><p>Multiangle light scattering (MALS) experiments were performed immediately following size-exclusion chromatography by inline measurement of static light-scattering (DAWN HELEOS II, Wyatt Technology), differential refractive index (Optilab rEX, Wyatt Technology) and ultraviolet absorbance (Agilent 1200&#x000a0;UV, Agilent Techologies).

Control and siRNA-treated cells expressing HA-tagged VAMP2, VAMP3, or VAMP8 were mixed together, fixed without permeabilization, and labeled with anti-HA, then permeabilized and labeled with anti-CALM. Knocking down CALM increases the surface expression of all three VAMPs. The scale bar represents 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m.</p><p>(B) Endocytosis of anti-HA in cells expressing HA-tagged VAMPs. Antibody was bound to the cells at 4&#x000b0;C, then the cells were warmed to 37&#x000b0;C for 2&#x02013;30&#x000a0;min and antibody remaining at the cell surface was quantified by flow cytometry. Each point is derived from at least three separate experiments; the error bars show the SEM. Knocking down CALM effectively abolishes the uptake of all three VAMPs. The specificity of the&#x000a0;knockdown phenotype was demonstrated by&#x000a0;stably transfecting VAMP8-HA-expressing cells&#x000a0;with siRNA-resistant myc-tagged CALM (CALMres wt) and knocking down endogenous CALM. Expression of the CALM construct almost completely rescues the knockdown phenotype.</p><p>See also <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>CALM Binds Directly to VAMP8, VAMP3, and VAMP2</p><p>(A) GST Pull downs using His<sub>6</sub>MycCALM<sub>ANTH</sub> and the GST-fusion proteins indicated.
