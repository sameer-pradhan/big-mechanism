 <body>
 Previous studies with monoclonal antibodies had shown that decorin and its glycosaminoglycan-free core protein bound to
affinity and low-affinity sites with KD values of about [=11688495 20 nm kd] and [=11688495 130 nm kd] respectively for the intact [=P02751 proteoglycan protein] and of [=11688487 10 nm kd] and
[=11688487 110 nm kd] respectively for [=P07585 decorin protein] core protein (Fig. 1).
