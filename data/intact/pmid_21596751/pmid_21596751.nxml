    Endorepellin, the Angiostatic Module of Perlecan, Interacts with Both the α2β1 Integrin and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 (VEGFR2)

    <p>
     Endorepellin, the C-terminal module of perlecan, negatively regulates angiogenesis counter to its proangiogenic parental molecule. Endorepellin (the C-terminal domain V of perlecan) binds the α2β1 integrin on endothelial cells and triggers a signaling cascade that leads to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we show that both perlecan and endorepellin bind directly and with high affinity to both VEGF receptors 1 and 2, in a region that differs from VEGFA-binding site. In both human and porcine endothelial cells, this interaction evokes a physical down-regulation of both the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2, with concurrent activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and downstream attenuation of
     <em>

     transcription. We demonstrate that endorepellin requires both the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2 for its angiostatic activity. Endothelial cells that express α2β1 integrin but lack VEGFR2, do not respond to endorepellin treatment. Thus, we provide a new paradigm for the activity of an antiangiogenic protein and mechanistically explain the specificity of endorepellin for endothelial cells, the only cells that simultaneously express both receptors. We hypothesize that a mechanism such as dual receptor antagonism could operate for other angiostatic fragments.

    ) and processed forms of matrix proteins such as thrombospondin, endostatin, and endorepellin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     3
    </xref>
    ). Most of these activities are mediated by VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), which is located at strategic domains of the endothelial plasma membrane. This specialized topology facilitates rapid and efficient signal transduction through receptor homodimerization and association with co-receptors leading to recruitment of downstream signaling molecules (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     4
    </xref>
    ). A central mechanism for modulating cellular responses to VEGFA occurs via activation of various integrin receptors (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     5
    </xref>
    ), which, by functionally coupling with VEGFR2, regulate developmental and pathological angiogenesis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     6
    </xref>
    ). For example, endothelial cell binding to vitronectin through αvβ3 integrin positively regulates VEGFR2 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     7
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     8
    </xref>
    ), whereas expression of active αvβ3 induces VEGF secretion thereby stimulating tumor growth and angiogenesis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     9
    </xref>
    ). Moreover, activated αvβ3 co-localizes with VEGFR2 on tumor endothelial cells (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     10
    </xref>
    ) and angiogenesis in transgenic mice expressing a phosphorylation-defective β3 integrin is impaired due to an inability of β3 integrin to form a functional bipartite complex with VEGFR2 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     11
    </xref>
    ). These results demonstrate a functional interplay between αvβ3 integrin and VEGFR2 that leads to enhancement of ligand-induced activity of this receptor tyrosine kinase upon integrin engagement (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     12
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Several members of the β1 integrin family have also been involved in regulating angiogenesis and VEGFR2 activity (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     13
    </xref>
    –
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     16
    </xref>
    ). For instance, α9β1 integrin binds VEGFA and cooperates with VEGFR2 in promoting angiogenesis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     17
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     18
    </xref>
    ). In contrast, α1β1 integrin induces T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates and silences VEGFR2 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     19
    </xref>
    ) as well as caveolin-1 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     20
    </xref>
    ). A functional interaction between β1 integrins and VEGFR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of infantile hemangiomas (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     21
    </xref>
    ) and is required for matrix-bound VEGFA signaling in endothelial cells (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     22
    </xref>
    ). Notably, VEGFR2 associates with two thrombospondin receptors, namely CD36 and β1 integrin, and activation of VEGFR2 by VEGFA is suppressed by antiangiogenic domains of thrombospondin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     23
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Genetic ablation studies have revealed specialized functions for several cell-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) that depend on their ability to coordinate functional interactions between VEGFs and their cognate receptors (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     24
    </xref>
    ). The current view is that cell surface HSPGs potentiate the duration and magnitude of VEGFA signaling through VEGFR2, the main receptor of vascular endothelial cells, and these activities have been corroborated by studies focused on vasculogenesis and tumor angiogenesis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     25
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     26
    </xref>
    ). Less is known about the secreted HSPGs such as perlecan, which was originally shown to bind endothelial cell surface via β1 and β3 integrins (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     27
    </xref>
    ). In addition to being a key component of basement membranes (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     28
    </xref>
    ) and cell surfaces (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     29
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     30
    </xref>
    ), perlecan modulates several biological processes by regulating the activity of growth factors and receptors through high affinity interactions via its N-terminal HS or its modular protein core (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     31
    </xref>
    –
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     33
    </xref>
    ). Perlecan (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     34
    </xref>
    ), acts as an early-response gene that is transcriptionally induced by TGFβ1 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     35
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     36
    </xref>
    ) and cyclic mechanical strain (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     37
    </xref>
    ) but repressed by interferon-γ (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     38
    </xref>
    ). Deregulated perlecan expression plays a role in cancer progression (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     39
    </xref>
    –
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     42
    </xref>
    ), lipid uptake (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     43
    </xref>
    ), and vascular injury and thrombosis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     44
    </xref>
    –
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     47
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    Under homeostasis, perlecan binds VEGFA via its HS chains (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     48
    </xref>
    ) where it is released by heparanase (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     49
    </xref>
    ) and presented to VEGFR2 for signaling. Indeed, endothelial HS regulates VEGF-induced vascular permeability (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     50
    </xref>
    ). Notably, VEGFA induces perlecan synthesis via activation of VEGFR2 in microvascular endothelial cells (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     51
    </xref>
    ), indicating a positive feedback loop regulating VEGFA and perlecan biosynthesis. In contrast, sustained VEGFA blockade causes a marked up-regulation of perlecan in hepatoblastoma xenografts and sustained VEGFR2 activation (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     52
    </xref>
    ). In agreement with these findings, perlecan knockdown attenuates the proliferative response to both VEGFA and FGF2 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     53
    </xref>
    –
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     55
    </xref>
    ). However, in fibrosarcoma xenografts, suppression of perlecan favors tumor growth and invasion (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     56
    </xref>
    ), suggesting that these biological responses are cell context-specific.
   </p>
   <p>
    We have recently discovered that endorepellin, a C-terminal angiostatic fragment of perlecan, binds α2β1 integrin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     57
    </xref>
    –
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     60
    </xref>
    ) and induces the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, which inactivates several receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR2 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     61
    </xref>
    ). We further discovered that perlecan and α2β1 integrin are directly involved in vertebrate embryonic angiogenesis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     62
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     63
    </xref>
    ), and attenuation of perlecan expression leads to an abnormal accumulation and localization of VEGFA (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     64
    </xref>
    ). These data suggest that perlecan might be directly involved in modulating the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling axis. In this work, we discovered that perlecan binds with high affinity to both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 via the C-terminal domain V/endorepellin. The concerted interaction of endorepellin, α2β1 integrin, and VEGFR2 leads to a transcriptional repression of VEGFA production, thereby contributing to the antiangiogenic activity of endorepellin. Our work provides a new paradigm for antiangiogenic fragments derived from large precursors, that is “a dual receptor” antagonism. We predict that a similar bioactivity could be operational for other processed forms of angiostatic matrix molecules.

       Preparation of IR800-labeled Endorepellin, Pulldown, and In-cell Binding Assays

      <p>
       Purified endorepellin was labeled with the IR800 dye using IRDye® 800CW labeling kit (LI-COR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, endorepellin was mixed with dye in a molar ratio of 1:1 and kept for 2 h at 20 °C while protecting the vial from light. IRDye 800CW dye bears an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-reactive group that couples to aliphatic amines, especially lysine residues, thereby forming stable conjugates. Free dye was removed from the labeled endorepellin by using 0.5-ml Pierce Zeba Desalting spin columns. A 10% SDS-PAGE was run to check the labeled endorepellin. For pulldown assays, protein A-Sepharose magnetic beads (GE Healthcare) were washed with TBS and absorbed with 2 μg of VEGFR1-Fc or VEGFR2-Fc in 0.1% BSA-TBS (with protease inhibitors) for 18 h at 4 °C. The beads were blocked with 1% BSA-TBS for 1 h at 25 °C, washed, and incubated for 3 h with 1 μg of IR800-labeled endorepellin at 25 °C. Following extensive washing, the beads were boiled in reducing buffer, and supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and scanned using Odyssey (version 2.1, LI-COR). For in-cell binding assays, confluent wild-type and VEGFR1- or VEGFR2-expressing PAE cells were serum-starved for 3 h and incubated with IR800-endorepellin (50 n

The cells were washed a further three times with PBS and blocked at 4 °C for 2 h with 5% BSA/PBS. Once blocked, primary antibody (rabbit anti-VEGFA) was added for 2 h at a dilution of 1:200 in 1% BSA/PBS. The cells were then washed three times with PBS. Anti-rabbit IR800-labeled secondary antibody was added for 1 h and used to visualize VEGFA levels. The values were normalized using the far-red fluorescent DNA dye DRAQ5

Cells were switched to serum-free medium 2 h prior to each treatment. Slides were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and fixed/permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 10 min. Subsequently, slides were subjected to standard immunofluorescence protocols and mounted with VECTASHIELD from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). PAE cells were subjected to various assays, including capillary morphogenesis in Matrigel and actin disassembly assays using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (

For confocal microscopy, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 s, and blocked with 5% BSA. Following incubation with various primary antibodies, detection was determined using goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor® 488 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor® 568 (Invitrogen), and, when appropriate, incubated with DAPI to visualize the nuclei. Slides were examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) with a Neofluar 40×/1.3 oil immersion objective. Merged images represent single optical sections (&lt; 0.8 μm), collected with the pinhole set to 1 Airy Unit for the red channel, and adjusted to give the same optical slice thickness in the green and blue channels. Images were acquired in single confocal planes to more precisely determine co-localization. Image processing and analysis were done using Zeiss LSM 510 software (version 3.2). Z-Stacks were acquired using a 63× oil objective of an Olympus IX70 microscope. Filters were set to 488 and 568 nm for dual channel imaging, and Z stacks were acquired at 0.36-μm intervals. All the images were analyzed using Laser Sharp 2000 in conjugation with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).

       Endorepellin Inhibits VEGFA Production in Endothelial Cells

      <p>
       Based on the profound antiangiogenic activity of endorepellin, we hypothesized that endorepellin could modulate endogenous VEGFA, a major proangiogenic factor. Thus, we measured intracellular VEGFA protein levels after exposing HUVECs to endorepellin (100 n
       <span>

       ) for various time points. We found a time-dependent and highly significant inhibition of endogenous VEGFA production in endothelial cells (

       ), indicating that endorepellin was specifically affecting VEGFA levels. In agreement with these findings, qPCR utilizing cDNAs synthesized from the reported time points revealed a significant down-regulation in the expression of

       Endorepellin-evoked Down-regulation of VEGFA Is Associated with SHP-1 and Requires α2β1 Integrin
      </title>
      <p>
       We have shown recently that endorepellin evokes an integrin α2β1-mediated activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, found to be physically associated via the cytoplasmic domain of the α2 integrin subunit. This interaction leads to a dynamic activation of SHP-1 and dephosphorylation of various receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR2 (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        61
       </xref>
       ). Thus, we tested the effects of a SHP-1 inhibitor (NSC87877, 1 μ
       <span>
        m
       </span>
       ) (

       </sup>
       staining of nuclear DNA. Theoretically, a phosphatase inhibitor should prolong VEGFA levels and proangiogenic signaling by indirectly increasing VEGFA production due to a positive feedback loop on receptor tyrosine kinases. We discovered a significant enhancement of endogenous VEGFA levels evoked by the SHP-1 inhibitor, and these changes lasted for 4 h with a maximum at 2 h (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 1
       </xref>
       ,
       <em>

       </em>
       and
       <em>
        E
       </em>
       ). We note that NSC87877 is a dual inhibitor of SHP-1 and SHP-2 activity (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        76
       </xref>
       ). However, we have shown that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SHP-2 in endothelial cells did not dampen the response to endorepellin in contrast to siRNA-mediated SHP-1 knockdown (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        61
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       If endorepellin was acting through activation of SHP-1 or another Tyr phosphatase to down-regulate the production and secretion of VEGFA, then both global and SHP-1-specific inhibitors should recover VEGFA production, even in the presence of endorepellin. Thus, we determined the levels of secreted VEGFA using slot blot assays of media conditioned by endothelial cells treated with endorepellin in the presence or absence of Na

       ). A similar, albeit less dramatic recovery was obtained with intracellular levels of VEGFA (data not shown). Quantification of four independent experiments showed not only the two Tyr phosphatase inhibitors effectively blocked endorepellin-mediated down-regulation of VEGFA but also the overall secretion was increased 2–3-fold (

       Endorepellin Evokes a Concurrent Internalization and Down-regulation of α2β1 Integrin and VEGFR2
      </title>
      <p>
       The results presented above suggest that both the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2 could be affected by endorepellin. Therefore, we performed confocal laser microscopy on endothelial cells challenged with endorepellin. We discovered that both α2β1 integrin (
       <em>
        green
       </em>
       ) and VEGFR2 (
       <em>
        red
       </em>
       ) were internalized within 10 min following endorepellin treatment and co-localized in small vesicles near the inner leaflets of the plasma membrane (

       ,
       <em>

       </em>
       ). In addition, already at 10 min, we observed larger vesicles in perinuclear regions, which became more prominent at 20 min (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       ,
       <em>

       </em>
       and

       </em>
       ,
       <em>

       </em>
       ). In contrast, untreated endothelial cells showed no basal co-localization of the two receptors (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       <em>
        A
       </em>
       ). High magnification confocal microscopy using Z-stacks showed progressive co-localization of both receptors evoked by endorepellin (
       <a>

        ,
        <em>
         white arrows
        </em>
       </a>
       ). In contrast to endorepellin, VEGFA evoked internalization of VEGFR2 but did not affect the α2β1 integrin (

        <em>
         B
        </em>
       </a>
       ). Immunoblotting analysis showed that the levels of VEGFR2 were rapidly and progressively down-regulated by endorepellin (

       <em>

       ), and these effects were completely abolished by Na

       </xref>
       <em>

       </em>
       ). Quantification of three independent experiments showed that the levels of VEGFR2 declined rapidly (
       <em>
        t
       </em>
       ½ ∼ 5 min,
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       <em>
        F
       </em>
       ). Concurrent down-regulation of the α2β1 integrin was also established (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       <em>
        G
       </em>
       ), and this decline was slightly faster than that of VEGFR2 (
       <em>
        t
       </em>
       ½ ∼ 3.5 min,

        Fig. 2
       </xref>
       <em>
        H
       </em>
       ). Thus, endorepellin could interact with both α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2, causing rapid internalization and degradation of both receptors. These findings further strengthen the concept of dual receptor antagonism.

       Perlecan Interacts Directly with VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 via Its C-terminal Domain V Endorepellin
      </title>
      <p>
       In light of the fact that VEGFR2 and α2β1 were co-down-regulated by endorepellin and due to the association of VEGFR2 with β1-containing integrins (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        21

       –
       <xref ref-type="bibr">

       </xref>
       ), we hypothesized that endorepellin could promote the formation of a multireceptor signaling complex by acting as a molecular “bridge” between the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2. First, we separated by gel electrophoresis VEGFR1-Fc and VEGFR2-Fc, which contain the extracellular ligand-binding domain of either receptor fused to the Fc portion of IgG. Second, we transferred the gels to nitrocellulose membranes, and lastly, we overlaid the membranes with soluble endorepellin. Endorepellin bound both receptors (

       To verify the novel interaction between endorepellin and VEGFR1/2, we utilized slot-blot assays in which the receptors are not denatured as in the overlay assay shown above. We also utilized VEGFA and endorepellin as bound substrates. In these assays, endorepellin specifically bound to both VEGFR1-Fc and VEGFR2-Fc (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 3
       </xref>
       <em>

       ), and VEGFA bound to both receptors as expected (

        Fig. 3
       </xref>
       <em>
        C
       </em>
       ). We further found that there was no binding of endorepellin to VEGFA (
       <xref ref-type="fig">

       </xref>
       ,

       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       To establish whether the parent HSPG perlecan could also bind VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, we utilized human perlecan in solid-phase binding assays. To avoid the possibility of nonspecific binding of perlecan to the Fc fragment of the chimeric receptors, we used, as immobilized substrates, recombinant ectodomains of VEGFR1 (Ig
       <sub>
        2–7
       </sub>
       ) and VEGFR2 (Ig
       <sub>

       </sub>
       ). These soluble ectodomains contain the ligand-binding sites for VEGFA, that is, Ig
       <sub>
        2–3
       </sub>
       . We discovered that perlecan bound to both receptors with relatively high affinity (

        <sub>

       </em>
       and
       <em>
        E
       </em>
       ). Notably, the perlecan bound to either receptor ectodomain could not be displaced by a 6-fold molar excess of heparin (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 3
       </xref>
       <em>
        F
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, we determined whether endorepellin could compete out perlecan binding. To distinguish between the C-terminal domain V/endorepellin and whole perlecan, we employed a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for domain III of perlecan protein core (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        69
       </xref>
       ) or a rabbit anti-perlecan domain V (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        58
       </xref>
       ), which recognizes both perlecan and endorepellin. Notably, similar amounts of perlecan bound to either receptor in the presence or absence of a molar excess of endorepellin when detected with the anti-domain III antibody (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 3
       </xref>
       <em>
        G
       </em>
       ). However, an additive effect was noted when the same experiments were repeated using the anti-domain V/endorepellin (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 3
       </xref>
       <em>
        H
       </em>
       ). These findings raised the possibility that other regions of perlecan protein core could also mediate a specific binding to VEGFR1 or VEGFR2. An alternate possibility is that perlecan could interact with endorepellin bound to the ectodomains of the receptors, a notion supported by the fact that perlecan has a tendency to self-assemble into dimeric and oligomeric forms via their C termini (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        77
       </xref>
       ). To test this hypothesis, we incubated for 18 h the receptors with molar excess of endorepellin (400 n
       <span>
        m
       </span>
       ), blocked the bound endorepellin with the rabbit anti-endorepellin polyclonal antibody, and then incubated the complexes with perlecan. Following an additional 18-h incubation, the plates were reacted with the monoclonal anti-domain III antibody (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 3

       </em>
       ,
       <em>

       </em>
       ). The results showed abrogation of perlecan binding (

       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        right panel
       </em>
       ). An unrelated mouse monoclonal Ig was incapable of blocking perlecan binding (data not shown). We conclude that perlecan utilizes its C-terminal domain V/endorepellin as the primary binding module for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.

       Detailed Analysis of Endorepellin Binding to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2

      <p>
       To determine in detail the binding affinity and specificity of endorepellin for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, we performed solid-phase binding assays using immobilized ectodomains of either receptor. To validate the findings presented above, we measured the binding affinity of dimeric and fully functional recombinant VEGFA to VEGFR1/2 and found that VEGFA bound in a saturable and high affinity manner to the ectodomains of both receptors (

       ), VEGFA binding to either receptor was in the picomolar range, with ∼5-fold stronger affinity for VEGFR1 as compared with VEGFR2,

       Specificity of binding to VEGFR2 was further proven by utilizing recombinant LG3, the terminal globular domain of endorepellin (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        74
       </xref>
       ). Under identical experimental conditions and using the same antibody, LG3 did not bind to VEGFR1 (
       <a>
        supplemental Fig. S2
        <em>
         A

       ) or VEGFR2 (data not shown). These negative controls are important because they rule out the involvement of the His

       tag in binding to the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 and suggest that more proximal portions of endorepellin are responsible for VEGFR binding.
      </p>
      <p>
       To eliminate the possibility that the endorepellin-VEGFR interaction might be due to a charge effect, we performed competition experiments in which a constant amount of endorepellin (100 n
       <span>
        m
       </span>
       ) was bound to immobilized receptors and then incubated with increasing molar amounts of heparin. We found that even high concentrations (∼20-fold molar excess) of heparin did not appreciably displace endorepellin from either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 (
       <a>
        supplemental Fig. S2,
        <em>
         B

        and
        <em>
         C
        </em>
       </a>
       ). These results indicate that the binding of endorepellin to the ectodomains of VEGFR1/2 is specific and not due to electrostatic interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, we performed similar competition binding experiments using a molar excess of recombinant VEGFA. In three independent experiments, we found no appreciable displacement of endorepellin by VEGFA from either receptor (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 4

       </em>
       and
       <em>
        F
       </em>
       ). To further corroborate these findings, we utilized recombinant VEGFE, an Orf virus VEGFA-like product that specifically binds VEGFR2 but not VEGFR1 (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        78
       </xref>
       ). Under the same experimental conditions, a molar excess of VEGFE could not displace bound endorepellin from either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 (

        and
        <em>
         B
        </em>
       </a>
       ). Analogous to the noncanonical binding to the α2β1 integrin (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        73
       </xref>
       ), the binding of endorepellin to VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 was independent of the cations Ca

        </em>
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we utilized human recombinant placenta growth factor, a member of the VEGF family, which specifically binds to the second Ig-like repeat of VEGFR1 but not to VEGFR2 (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        79
       </xref>
       ,
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        80
       </xref>
       ). Again, under the same conditions, a 10-fold molar excess of recombinant placenta growth factor could not displace the VEGFR1-bound endorepellin (data not shown). The lack of endorepellin displacement by VEGFA, VEGFE, and recombinant placenta growth factor indicates that endorepellin binds to a region within the ectodomain of both receptors that does not overlap with that of natural VEGFR1/2 ligands.

       Endorepellin and VEGFA Bind Concurrently on Ectodomain of Either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2

      <p>
       The previous results raised the possibility that endorepellin and VEGFA could simultaneously bind on the ectodomains of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in a noncompetitive fashion. To test this hypothesis, we performed binding experiments using a low concentration (20 n
       <span>
        m
       </span>
       ) of either endorepellin or VEGFA and incubated together with a 10-fold molar excess (200 n
       <span>
        m
       </span>
       ) of either ligand. At the end of the co-incubation, the wells were exposed to either antiendorepellin or anti-VEGFA antibodies. Notably, neither ligand was capable of competing with each other in receptor binding, and both bound to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in a similar fashion (

       and
       <em>

       IR800-labeled Endorepellin Binds to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2

       To further investigate the novel binding of endorepellin to VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 and to avoid the possibility that a nonspecific antibody/antigen reactions could induce false positive results, we established a novel
       <em>
        in vitro
       </em>
       binding assay devoid of antibodies. First, we labeled endorepellin with the infrared dye IRDye® 800CW and monitored IR800-endorepellin by gel electrophoresis. IR800-endorepellin was properly labeled and migrated at ∼100 kDa (
       <xref ref-type="fig">

       ), as expected for a protein of ∼85 kDa conjugated with several dye molecules. Notably, IR800-endorepellin bound in a saturable manner to both VEGFR1 (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 5

       ) with

       and 76 n

       , respectively. In contrast, IR800-endorepellin bound in a nonsaturable, linear fashion to immobilized BSA (
       <a>
        supplemental Fig. S4
        <em>
         A
        </em>
       </a>
       ). Decreased affinity for either receptor is likely derived from the modifications caused by the covalent linkage of the infrared dye. That is, the binding of N-hydroxysuccinimide residues to primary aliphatic amines such as lysine side chains might have interfered with binding. However, the bound IR800-endorepellin could be efficiently displaced by unlabeled endorepellin (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 5
       </xref>
       ,
       <em>

       </em>
       and
       <em>
        D
       </em>
       ), indicating specificity of binding. Similar to the unlabeled endorepellin, VEGFA (data not shown) and heparin could not appreciably displace IR800-endorepellin from VEGFR2 (
       <a>
        supplemental Fig. S4
        <em>
         B
        </em>
       </a>
       ). Even a 22-fold molar excess of heparin did not appreciably displace IR800-labeled endorepellin from the immobilized VEGFR2. This is important because it excludes ionic interactions between the positively charged IR800 and negatively charged amino acid residues within the ectodomain of VEGFR2.

       To further validate the interaction of IR800-labeled endorepellin with VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, we performed pulldown assays. First, we linked the VEGFR1-Fc and VEGFR2-Fc to protein A-Sepharose magnetic beads; then, after blocking with 1% BSA, the complexes were incubated with IR800-endorepellin. The majority (&gt;95%) of IR800-endorepellin bound to both receptors when analyzed by Odyssey (

We believe this is robust evidence for the specific interaction of endorepellin with VEGF receptors insofar as both receptors are vectorially bound to the protein A-beads via their C-terminal Fc portions, thereby allowing their N-terminal ligand-binding domains to be exposed to the solvent where soluble endorepellin can interact.

       Endorepellin Attenuates VEGFA-evoked Activation of VEGFR2 in Human Endothelial Cells

       To establish whether endorepellin would interfere with VEGFA signaling through VEGFR2, we performed immunoprecipitation studies using an anti-VEGFR2 antibody in endothelial cells treated for 10 min with VEGFA and/or endorepellin. We found that endorepellin attenuated VEGFA-evoked phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr-1175 (
       <em>
        p
       </em>
       &lt; 0.05, in three independent experiments) analogous to the efficient block by the specific VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor SU5416 (

       ) (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        81
       </xref>
       ). It is important to note that Tyr-1175 within the intracellular VEGFR2 domain is a key phosphorylation site that binds phospholipase Cγ and various adaptor proteins such as Sck and Shb, which lead to sustained downstream signaling including stimulation of cell proliferation, migration, survival, and vascular permeability (
       <xref ref-type="bibr">
        1
       </xref>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       In further experiments, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate the α2 integrin subunit in the presence of endorepellin but not in the presence of VEGFA (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 5
       </xref>
       <em>
        H
       </em>
       ). As an internal control, VEGFA was capable of inducing phosphorylation at Tyr-1175, and endorepellin counteracted this activity (
       <xref ref-type="fig">
        Fig. 5
       </xref>
       <em>
        H
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, we were able to perform the reverse co-immunoprecipitation using the anti-α2 integrin subunit. In the reciprocal experiment, using antibodies directed against the α2 integrin subunit for the immunoprecipitation step, VEGFR2 co-precipitated with the α2 integrin subunit only when endorepellin was present but not when VEGFA alone was used (
       <a>
        supplemental Fig. S5
       </a>
       ). Thus, we conclude that endorepellin induces the recruitment of α2β1 integrin to the VEGFR2 coincident with antagonism of VEGFA activity.

       Having established a physical link for endorepellin to both the integrin α2β1 and VEGFR2 in human endothelial cells, we decided to utilize a simpler cell system in which both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are barely detectable, that is, the PAE and the two transgenic cells expressing either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 (

        Fig. 6
       </xref>
       <em>

       ). Most importantly, preincubation of the PAE-VEGFR2 with a monoclonal antibody directed against the ectodomain of VEGFR2 significantly inhibited IR800-endorepellin binding (

       Finally, PAE-VEGFR2 responded to endorepellin in a similar fashion as HUVECs. Specifically, VEGFA-evoked phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Tyr-1175 was markedly suppressed by co-incubation with endorepellin (

       and
       <em>

       Endorepellin Inhibits VEGFA-mediated Stimulation of VEGFA Transcription
      </title>
      <p>
       To investigate in detail the function of endorepellin following its high affinity binding to VEGFR2, we analyzed VEGFA transcriptional regulation as an output of luciferase activity. To this end, we made stable transfectants of PAE-VEGFR2 cells using a reporter plasmid containing a 2.6-Kb genomic fragment encompassing the human
       <em>
        VEGFA
       </em>
       promoter, from −2361 to +298 relative to the transcriptional start site, cloned upstream of firefly luciferase (

       ). Mass cultures of stably transfected PAE-VEGFR2

       cells were exposed for 4 h to VEGFA, endorepellin, or a combination of both in serum-free conditions. Endorepellin suppressed
       <em>
        VEGFA

       <em>
        D
       </em>
       ). In agreement with the experiments reported above for both HUVECs and PAE-VEGFR2 cells, the effect of VEGFA and endorepellin, either alone or in combination, was totally abolished by co-incubation with 1 μ

       (data not shown). Next, we measured luciferase mRNA levels by qPCR and found that they were also significantly down-regulated following a 4-h treatment with endorepellin (

       following a 4-h treatment with endorepellin and obtained a significant down-regulation (data not shown) similar to the transcriptional inhibition of the reporter gene described above. These combined functional and biochemical data corroborate the results presented above and strongly support the notion that endorepellin interacts with VEGFR2 to partially block VEGFA-mediated activation of the receptor and downstream induction of

    DISCUSSION
   </title>
   <p>
    About 24 years ago, Yurchenco and co-workers (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     77
    </xref>
    ) described the macromolecular architecture of perlecan protein core as a “flexible tandem array of globular domains” and speculated that, in analogy to other modular proteins such as fibronectin, each perlecan domain would prove in time to have its own function. The multiple functions of one of the perlecan protein core domains certainly confirm this prediction. The fact that perlecan domain V/endorepellin binds with high affinity not only cell surface receptors but also proteins involved in cancer and angiogenesis such as FGF7 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     84
    </xref>
    ), FGF-binding protein (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     85
    </xref>
    ), endostatin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     57
    </xref>
    ), extracellular matrix protein 1 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     86
    </xref>
    ), and progranulin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     71
    </xref>
    ), point to an important biological role for this multimodular proteoglycan (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     87
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     88
    </xref>
    ). In the present study, we discovered that perlecan binds to VEGFR2 via its C-terminal domain V/endorepellin and can counteract the bioactivity of VEGFA through a portion of its protein core opposite to where the proangiogenic HS chains are located. Thus, we provide evidence for a bivalent activity of a basement membrane and pericellular HSPG that could act in a concerted manner to affect the α2β1 integrin receptor and VEGFR2, which are both key players in angiogenesis. A current working model (
    <xref ref-type="fig">
     Fig. 8
    </xref>
    ) summarizes our present findings. Endorepellin could act as an allosteric inhibitor of VEGFR2 by binding to a region different than VEGFA, which is known to bind Ig
    <sub>
     2–3
    </sub>
    . This binding likely occurs via the two proximal LG1 and LG2 domains, whereas LG3 wound bind to the α2β1 integrin. This dual receptor binding leads to rapid internalization of both receptors and degradation. On the other hand, endorepellin activates the phosphatase SHP-1, which in turn would dephosphorylate key tyrosine residues in the VEGFR2, thereby blocking prosurvival and proangiogenic downstream signaling pathways. Moreover, this dual antagonistic activity of endorepellin in attenuating both α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2 causes a transcriptional repression of
    <em>
     VEGF
    </em>
    gene transcription leading to reduced VEGFA mRNA and protein production and reduced VEGFA secretion by endothelial cells. The activity of endorepellin is analogous to that of TIMP-2, which also involves a SHP-1-dependent mechanism of heterologous receptor inactivation. Specifically, TIMP-2 binds to the α3β1 integrin and induces SHP-1, which in turn dephosphorylates several receptor tyrosine kinases, including VEGFR2 and FGFR1, via a mechanism that is independent of its antiprotease activity (

    morphants (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     94
    </xref>
    ), a major downstream target of VEGFR2, indicate that perlecan is a key upstream component of the VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling pathway. We discovered previously that perlecan knockdown causes a paradoxical increase in total VEGFA protein with abnormal deposits of VEGFA often away from normal vascular patterning and that the perlecan morphants could be partially rescued by microinjections of human recombinant VEGFA (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     64
    </xref>
    ). Consistent with this hypothesis, combined administration of perlecan and VEGFA to HUVECs enhances VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Tyr-951 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     64
    </xref>
    ). Similarly, a soluble form of perlecan domain I harboring HS chains enhances VEGFA activity on VEGFR2 phosphorylation at Tyr-951 and downstream Akt activation (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     95
    </xref>
    ). Collectively, these findings support a dual role for perlecan as a regulator of “proper” VEGFA localization and as a mediator of signaling through VEGFR2. Our current results support the novel hypothesis that perlecan and endorepellin evoke the recruitment of a larger signaling complex encompassing at least two transmembrane receptors and several intracellular binding partners, including, among others, SHP-1. This key tyrosine phosphatase is constitutively associated with the α2 integrin subunit in HUVECs (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     61
    </xref>
    ) and with VEGFR2 in HUVECs and PAE-VEGFR2 cells (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     82
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     96
    </xref>
    ). Thus, SHP-1 could function as the intracellular proximal bridge between the two receptors. It is known that SHP-1 needs steric activation to remove the autoinhibiting SH-2 domain from its active site as well as the activating phosphorylation site (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     97
    </xref>
    ). Endorepellin binding to the integrin-VEGFR2 complex could evoke this steric change through conformational changes in the integrin, whereas VEGFR2 could promote Tyr phosphorylation through its intracellular kinase domain.

    In the present study, we provide detailed analysis of endorepellin binding to VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Molar excess of VEGFA or heparin do not appreciably displace endorepellin from either receptor, indicating that binding of endorepellin to VEGFR1/2 is located in a region of the receptor ectodomain that does not overlap with VEGFA binding and that the endorepellin-VEGFR1/2 interaction is not due to electrostatic interactions. These results are important because it has been shown previously that the soluble ectodomain of VEGFR2, similar in structure to that used here, binds heparin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     98

    ) via a short stretch of basic amino acid residues located between Ig

    </sub>
    (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">

    ). Moreover, a highly basic decapeptide derived from this stretch inhibits VEGFA binding to VEGFR2 in the presence of heparin, suggesting a specific interaction rather than competition for VEGFR2 (

    ), then endorepellin might bind to Ig
    <sub>

    . However, the lack of displacement by heparin suggests that endorepellin might bind between Ig

    and Ig

    Notably, structural studies have confirmed that VEGFA by binding to Ig
    <sub>

    </sub>
    of VEGFR2 causes receptor dimerization and promotes further interaction via the membrane-proximal Ig

    </sub>
    (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     101
    </xref>
    ), which has been recently to be critical for receptor dimerization/activation and signaling (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     102
    </xref>
    ). Thus, endorepellin could potentially inhibit VEGFR2 dimerization as recently shown for antibodies targeting Ig
    <sub>

    </sub>
    (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     103

    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">

    ).

    Another important finding of this report is that the terminal globular domain of endorepellin, LG3, previously shown to directly interact with the α2 I domain of the α2β1 integrin (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     58
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     73
    </xref>
    ), does not bind to either VEGFR1 or -2. This result suggests that endorepellin could simultaneously bind to α2β1 integrin via LG3 and VEGFR2 via LG1–LG2 moieties (
    <xref ref-type="fig">
     Fig. 8
    </xref>
    ). Thus, our results provide a plausible explanation for the selective bioactivity of endorepellin for endothelial cells as only these cells express both the α2β1 integrin receptor and VEGFR2. This is a reasonable explanation for our previous
    <em>
     in vitro
    </em>
    and
    <em>
     in vivo
    </em>
    results, which have shown that cells expressing α2β1 even at high levels, such as fibroblasts, HT1080 fibrosarcoma, or A431 squamous carcinoma cells, do not respond to endorepellin both in migration assays and in disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     57
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     58
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     105
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    It is notable that, as for the case of other angiogenic integrins, genetic ablation of α2 integrin subunit leads to an enhanced angiogenesis in both tumor xenograft development (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     73
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     106
    </xref>
    ) and wound healing (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     107
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     108
    </xref>
    ). This anomalous phenotype could be explained in part by our previous and current findings. The lack of α2β1 integrin in mice is associated with lower levels and activity of SHP-1, which requires the intracellular domain of the α2 integrin subunit to be properly anchored in endothelial cells and liver (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     61
    </xref>
    ). This would lead to a protracted hyperactivation state for various receptor tyrosine kinases involved in prosurvival and proangiogenic activities. This is true for melanoma tumor xenografts grown in mice lacking the α2β1 integrin. Consistent with this hypothesis, mice lacking the α2β1 integrin and harboring syngeneic melanoma tumor xenografts exhibit an increase in tumor angiogenesis and a concurrent up-regulation of VEGFR1 in the tumor endothelium (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     106
    </xref>
    ). Moreover, lack of the α2β1 integrin could be also important because the endogenous circulating endorepellin would not be able to interact with its primary functional receptor. Indeed, endorepellin and its C-terminal LG3 fragments have been found in many body fluids, including blood, urine, and amniotic fluid (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     88
    </xref>
    ). Endorepellin is secreted by preapoptotic endothelial cells via cathepsin L (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     109
    </xref>
    ), whereas LG3 is found in the secretome of various tumor cells likely generated by BMP-1 (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     74
    </xref>
    ,
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     110
    </xref>
    ). Finally, low circulating levels of LG3 in breast cancer patients have been correlated with poor prognosis (
    <xref ref-type="bibr">
     111
    </xref>
    ).
   </p>
   <p>
    In conclusion, we provide a new paradigm for the activity of an antiangiogenic protein by demonstrating that endorepellin requires two receptors for its angiostatic activity, namely the α2β1 integrin and VEGFR2. As perlecan and endorepellin have been present for &gt;500 million years of evolution, we speculate that a mechanism such as “dual receptor antagonism,” could be operational for other members of the extracellular matrix or blood derivatives that are specifically acting on endothelial cell homeostasis. Moreover, our findings support endorepellin as a novel antiangiogenic modality that could supplement established therapies in clinical use or in preclinical stages.
