To investigate the protein machinery orchestrating myosin folding and assembly, we performed a comprehensive analysis of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> UNC-45. Our structural and biochemical data demonstrate that UNC-45 forms linear protein chains that offer multiple binding sites for cooperating chaperones and client proteins. Accordingly, Hsp70 and Hsp90, which bind to the TPR domain of UNC-45, could act in concert and with defined periodicity on captured myosin molecules. In&#x000a0;vivo analyses reveal the elongated canyon of the UCS domain as a myosin-binding site and show that multimeric UNC-45 chains support organization of sarcomeric repeats. In fact, expression of transgenes blocking UNC-45 chain formation induces dominant-negative defects in the sarcomere structure and function of wild-type worms. Together, these findings uncover a filament assembly factor that directly couples myosin folding with myofilament formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Highlights</title><p>&#x025ba; UNC-45 self-assembles a docking platform for multiple chaperone and client proteins &#x025ba; Hsp70/90 and myosin bind to specific sites on the TPR and UCS domains of UNC-45 &#x025ba; The UNC-45 multimer offers the proper spacing to couple myosin folding and assembly &#x025ba; In&#x000a0;vivo, UNC-45 chains support the formation of fully functional sarcomeric repeats</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>The myosin chaperone UNC-45 polymerizes into a linear chain that presents ordered binding sites for the myosin substrate and the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, coupling myosin folding with assembly of a functional muscle myofilament.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle development and function rely on the correct assembly of structural and motor proteins into a series of contractile units called the sarcomeres. Its main components, thin (actin) and thick (myosin) filaments, are organized in a precisely ordered, quasi-crystalline protein framework that is critical to link the formation of actin-myosin crossbridges with filament gliding and muscle contraction (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Sweeney and Houdusse, 2010</xref>). Although the basic components and the overall architecture of the sarcomere have been studied in detail, little is known about its highly complex assembly process (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sanger et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). In particular, the mechanism of myosin incorporation into thick filaments is poorly understood. So far, it has been shown that folding of the myosin motor domain involves the assistance of the general chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Du et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Etard et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaiser et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Srikakulam and Winkelmann, 2004</xref>) and of UCS-domain-containing proteins that function as myosin-specific chaperones (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hutagalung et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kachur and Pilgrim, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lord and Pollard, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wesche et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Bernstein, 2003</xref>). One founding member of the UCS family is the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> UNC-45 protein, which is highly conserved in metazoans (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Epstein and Thomson, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Venolia et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, and <italic>Xenopus</italic>, UNC-45 proteins are important for skeletal and cardiac muscle function and for muscle maintenance during stress (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bernick et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Etard et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Geach and Zimmerman, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Melkani et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Wohlgemuth et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, UNC-45 homologs exist in vertebrates, indicating a conserved requirement for the myosin-specific chaperone. Mice and humans have the two isoforms UNC45a and UNC45b either expressed in multiple tissues or restricted to myogenic processes in skeletal and cardiac muscles, respectively (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Price et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>). In line with this tissue specificity, abnormal UNC45b function is associated with severe muscle defects resulting in skeletal and cardiac myopathies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Janiesch et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Walker, 2001</xref>). To exert its cellular function, UNC-45 employs an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain implicated in binding the Hsp70/Hsp90 partner chaperones (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Srikakulam et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>), a central armadillo repeat (ARM) domain of unknown function and a C-terminal UCS domain that is critical to interact with the motor domain of myosin (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Venolia et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). Mutations affecting the UCS domain of <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> UNC-45 result in paralyzed worms with reduced amounts of thick filaments and severe myofibril disorganization (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Epstein and Thomson, 1974</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hoppe et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Venolia and Waterston, 1990</xref>), indicating that UNC-45 is important for myosin maturation and sarcomere organization (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Ao and Pilgrim, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kachur and Pilgrim, 2008</xref>). Indeed, UNC-45 does not only target substrate to Hsp90, but also functions itself as a chaperone promoting the folding and assembly of myosin molecules (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaiser et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Melkani et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite recent structural insight into the architecture of the central and UCS domain (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Blobel, 2010</xref>), the molecular mechanisms of UNC-45 in promoting thick filament assembly and its interactions with partner chaperones are not understood. To delineate these functions, we combined biochemical and structural analyses with in&#x000a0;vivo studies of the&#x000a0;<italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> UNC-45 protein. Intriguingly, our work reveals&#x000a0;a chaperone chain in which UNC-45 tandem modules assemble a multisite docking platform that enforces collaboration with Hsp70 and Hsp90 in a precisely defined pattern to assemble myosin filaments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Crystal Structure of the UNC-45 Protomer</title><p>To obtain insight into the mechanistic role of UNC-45, we crystallized the full-length protein from <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> (107&#x000a0;kDa) and determined its crystal structure at 2.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> available online). Structure comparison with related UCS proteins and analysis of local flexibility within the UNC-45 protomer reveals a four-domain architecture comprising an N-terminal TPR domain (TPR repeats 1&#x02013;3), a central domain (ARM repeats 1&#x02013;5), a neck domain (ARM repeats 6&#x02013;9) and a C-terminal UCS domain (ARM repeats 10&#x02013;17) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>A). The resultant overall structure resembles a proteinous mouth that is constituted by a lower jaw (central domain and attached TPR domain), an upper jaw (UCS domain), and the neck region connecting the functional elements. In the slightly open UNC-45 fold, which is 65&#x000a0;&#x000c5; high, 85&#x000a0;&#x000c5; long, and 45&#x000a0;&#x000c5; wide, the UCS domain protrudes in a 20&#x000b0; angle from the central domain and is situated above the interface of central and TPR domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B).</p><p>The TPR domain of UNC-45 is assembled by three TPR motifs, each containing two antiparallel &#x003b1; helices A and B. The helices are packed in a curved, right-handed superhelix featuring a shallow groove at its concave side that is critical to recognize and bind specific peptide ligands and to tether partner chaperones (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Scheufler et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). The TPR3 motif is followed by a 54&#x000a0;&#x000c5; long, kinked &#x003b1; helix (residues 115&#x02013;150) that contributes to both TPR and central domains, thus constraining their relative orientation. Analysis of disorder B factors indicates that the central domain is the most rigid part of UNC-45 (average B factor of 70&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) functioning as a molecular scaffold to maintain the orientation of the TPR domain (102&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) and the UCS domain (147&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>), the most flexible entity.</p><p>The central domain is a flat, rectangular protein ribbon that is structured by helices H1, H2, and H3 of ARM repeats 1&#x02013;5. Owing to specific H1 adaptations, which impede the spiraling arrangement of adjacent H2 and H3 helices, the consecutive ARM repeats constitute a slightly curved H2/H3 helix bilayer rather than a superhelix. The edge of the bilayer that is covered by the H1 helices is used to hold the TPR domain in place. The major part of this interface is contributed by helix H1 of ARM repeat 4 (helix 4H1) and its extended N-terminal loop, which intercalate into the cleft formed by the TPR1 and TPR2 motifs and mediate several short-distanced salt bridges (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B). Because most residues of this interface are highly conserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C), the precise positioning of the TPR to the central domain should be generally important for the function of UNC-45 proteins. Interactions with the second functional domain, the UCS domain, are mediated by residues located on the H3 side of the central domain. Here, helices 4H3 and 5H3 form a flat binding surface to accommodate the loops protruding from ARM repeats 10&#x02013;12. The relatively small size of this interface (339&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) and the prevalence of unspecific van der Waals interactions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>B) indicate that the UCS domain is less fixed than the TPR domain and though preoriented by leaning against the central domain may reposition when interacting with target proteins.</p><p>UCS and central domain are connected by the neck domain. Insertion of the highly flexible loop 508&#x02013;524 and deletion of helices 8H1 and 9H1 disrupt the interfaces between ARM repeats 8&#x02013;10, thereby unlocking the individual motifs from each other. As a result, the helix pairs of the neck domain adopt a superturn structure that accounts for a 180&#x000b0; bend in the UNC-45 fold directing the consecutive UCS domain back toward the N-terminal TPR domain, thus completing the UNC-45 mouth. The UCS domain itself forms an almost regular right-handed superhelix. The parallel packed helices of neighboring repeats assemble a spiraling scaffold with a long shallow groove that is lined by the H3 helices (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>A). Due to the irregular packing of the H2/H3 helix pairs of ARM repeats 12&#x02013;14, the UCS superhelix is interrupted at ARM repeat 13. Finally, the UCS domain encompasses an extended loop (residues 602&#x02013;630) that is inserted after helix 10H3 and represents one of the most conserved signature motifs of UCS proteins (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Hsp70 and Hsp90 Bind Differently to the TPR Domain of&#x000a0;UNC-45</title><p>Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones exert their protein folding function by collaborating with distinct cofactors that are required for substrate targeting. The physical link between chaperone and cochaperone is commonly mediated by binding of the C terminus of Hsp70/Hsp90 to the TPR domain of the targeting factor (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Scheufler et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Young et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). In the case of UNC-45, the interactions with Hsp70 and Hsp90 have not been addressed in detail, and thus the composition and organization of the chaperone complex that promotes myosin folding and assembly are still unclear. To characterize the interplay between the three chaperones, we performed a detailed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>A). For Hsp90 (DAF-21 in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic>), the ITC data revealed a tight interaction with UNC-45, thus confirming previous reports (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Srikakulam et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Notably, the apparent affinity for the C-terminal peptide (EDASRMEEVD, dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> &#x0223c;14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) was slightly higher than for full-length Hsp90 (K<sub>D</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0223c;31&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M), suggesting that the peptide-TPR interaction represents the main contact between the two chaperones. ITC measurements with the C-terminal peptide AGGPTIEEVD of Hsp70 (HSP-1 in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic>) revealed a weaker but robust affinity toward UNC-45 (K<sub>D</sub> &#x0223c;120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M). Owing to the low yield of recombinant Hsp70, we monitored complex formation with UNC-45 by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). To this end,&#x000a0;we compared the elution profiles of the isolated chaperones and complexes thereof. Importantly, UNC-45 coelutes with both&#x000a0;of its partner chaperones and is thus capable of forming complexes with Hsp70 and Hsp90 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>B). When equal amounts of Hsp70 and Hsp90 are incubated with UNC-45, the&#x000a0;Hsp90 chaperone is preferentially bound (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A). In&#x000a0;contrast, incubation of UNC-45 with an excess of the Hsp70&#x000a0;C-terminal peptide abolished interaction with Hsp90, showing&#x000a0;that both chaperones compete for the same binding site on the TPR domain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>A). To further exclude that complexes with Hsp70 and Hsp90 result from unspecific chaperone-substrate interactions, we introduced site-specific mutations in the TPR domain of UNC-45 (K82E) and in the C&#x000a0;termini of Hsp70 and Hsp90 (deletion of the five terminal residues). SEC and ITC binding studies revealed that the introduced mutations abolished complex formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A&#x000a0;and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>B). We thus conclude that the TPR domain of UNC-45 is the main docking site for Hsp70 or Hsp90, allowing formation of defined complexes with either of the two general chaperones.</p><p>To address the individual binding modes of Hsp70 and Hsp90, we cocrystallized UNC-45 with oligopeptides reflecting the two C termini, respectively. In the 2.9&#x000a0;&#x000c5; electron density map of the UNC-45/Hsp90 complex, the eight C-terminal residues of Hsp90 could be unambiguously modeled into the TPR binding pocket. Accordingly, the Hsp90 C terminus ASRMEEVD is bound in a bent conformation undergoing multiple main-chain and side-chain interactions with highly conserved UNC-45 residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>C, detailed description in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). In the crystal structure of the UNC-45/Hsp70 complex determined at 3.6&#x000a0;&#x000c5; resolution, the peptide ligand AGGPTIEEVD is bound in&#x000a0;a similarly bent conformation; however, the entire peptide is shifted &#x0223c;1.5&#x000a0;&#x000c5; away from the center of the domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). Consequently, the tip of the Hsp70 peptide turn is differently accommodated in the TPR cleft (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). Several interactions undergone with Hsp90 are broken in the UNC-45/Hsp70 complex structure, including the hydrogen bond with Asp114, the salt bridge with Lys59, and the hydrophobic contacts with Phe85 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;2</xref>D). Together, these differences should account for the preferential binding of Hsp90, as directly seen in our ITC binding studies. In addition to confirming the observed binding preferences, the structural data also visualize that both Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones are bound in a specific manner and are thus likely candidates to assist UNC-45 in myosin folding and assembly.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Interaction between UCS Domain and Muscle Myosin</title><p>Previous reports revealed that the UCS domain is critical to bind myosin (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Barral et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lord and Pollard, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Toi et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). To identify the corresponding interaction site, we carried out homology searches with DALI and observed that the UCS domain of UNC-45 is most similar to &#x003b2;-catenin (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S3</xref>A). Notably, most &#x003b2;-catenins have a conserved protein-binding groove that is undisclosed in several protein-ligand complex structures. Transferring the catenin-bound ligands to the superimposed UNC-45 allowed us to visualize the potential binding site for myosin, which is a lengthy canyon formed by highly conserved residues spanning the entire UCS domain in a screw-like manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>BC). The bottom of the 70&#x000a0;&#x000c5; long groove is formed by the H3 helices of ARM repeats 10&#x02013;17 and is well designed to accommodate polypeptide chains in extended conformation.</p><p>To characterize the myosin-binding canyon, we carried out systematic peptide binding studies using ITC and peptide spot analyses. In contrast to the yeast UCS protein She4 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Blobel, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Toi et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>), UNC-45 from <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> did not interact with myosin-derived peptides in these assays (data not shown). We thus pursued an in&#x000a0;vivo approach to test the relevance of the predicted myosin-binding canyon. Notably, the in&#x000a0;vivo analysis of UNC-45 is not trivial because loss of UNC-45 immediately leads to cytokinesis defects and embryonic lethality (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kachur et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kachur and Pilgrim, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Venolia and Waterston, 1990</xref>). We thus expressed selected UNC-45 mutants in worms harboring the <italic>unc-45 temperature-sensitive</italic> (<italic>ts</italic>) allele <italic>m94</italic> (E781K) and analyzed to which degree muscle function of the <italic>ts</italic> mutant was restored. To this end, we generated specific mutations that distorted the UCS canyon to different degrees (detailed description in the <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Information</xref>). Based on the structural comparison with &#x003b2;-catenin, we targeted the central passage of the canyon that is composed by&#x000a0;helix 13H3, the most conserved stretch of the UCS domain (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>C). As outlined in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A, the N758Y mutation was predicted to directly abolish the interaction with substrate, whereas the Y750W mutation was designed to modify the outer rim of the substrate-binding cleft. To further explore the myosin-binding site, we deleted the UCS signature motif 602&#x02013;630 that composes an elongated, highly conserved loop next to the UCS channel. Accordingly, the &#x00394;602&#x02013;630 mutation should discontinue the substrate-binding cleft and abrogate the interaction with myosin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). The N758Y, Y750W, and &#x00394;602&#x02013;630 mutants were transgenically expressed and assayed for their ability to rescue the motility of <italic>unc-45(m94)</italic> worms and to bind to the myosin heavy chain UNC-54. In contrast to the Y750W mutant, which is still capable to bind myosin and restore muscle function, the N758Y and &#x00394;602&#x02013;630 mutants neither rescue the defect in sarcomere organization nor bind to UNC-54 in immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>B&#x02013;3D and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Because all mutants interact with Hsp90 similar to wild-type, the myosin-binding mutations do not affect the structural integrity of UNC-45 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>D). Together, these findings demonstrate that the UCS canyon composes the major myosin-binding site of UNC-45 and most likely accommodates an unfolded portion of the myosin substrate, as also suggested previously (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Srikakulam et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>UNC-45 Crystallizes as a Polar Protein Filament</title><p>In the crystal lattice of UNC-45, two prominent crystal contacts can be discerned that lead to either a symmetric dimer, which is stabilized by juxtaposed central domains, or a continuous protein filament resulting from lateral associations of adjacent subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>A). To estimate the likelihood of whether the&#x000a0;crystallographic interfaces mediate oligomerization in solution, we performed a bioinformatic analysis with PISA (Protein Surfaces, Interfaces and Assemblies). Probability measures P<sub>&#x00394;G,IF</sub> of specific interfaces were derived from the gain in solvation energy upon complexation, with P<sub>&#x00394;G,IF</sub> &#x0003e; 0.5 pointing to hydrophilic/unspecific and P<sub>&#x00394;G,IF</sub>&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 0.5 to hydrophobic/specific interfaces. In contrast to the dimer interface that appears to be a crystal artifact (P<sub>&#x00394;G,IF</sub>&#x000a0;= 0.75), the extremely low P<sub>&#x00394;G,IF</sub> value of the UNC-45 filament interface (0.15) lies in the range of probabilities derived from typical protein interfaces (0.1&#x02013;0.4). Moreover, other structurally characterized protein filaments exhibit similar P<sub>&#x00394;G,IF</sub> values, some of which indicate an even smaller polymerization probability than UNC-45 (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). We thus suppose that UNC-45 may form similar linear multimers in solution, although the relatively small size of the interface (788&#x000a0;&#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>) suggests that UNC-45 chains are only transiently formed or may need further factors to be stabilized.</p><p>Concerning its multimeric architecture, the UNC-45 chain represents a unique filamentous structure resulting from the mouth-to-neck assembly of single subunits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). In the crystal lattice, adjacent subunits in the UNC-45 chain are held together by a composite four-helix bundle to which neighboring molecules contribute two helices each (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>C). With the exception of the Glu447-Lys105<sup>&#x02217;</sup> salt bridge (the asterisk marks the partner molecule), the filament interface is exclusively formed by hydrophobic residues arranged in a zipper-like manner in the center of the four-helix bundle. The backbone of the resultant UNC-45 filament is thus composed by the tethered superhelices ARM1-8 and TPR1-3<sup>&#x02217;</sup>, whereas the UCS domain, which is proposed to bind myosin, extends in a characteristic manner away from the filament axis and does not participate in filament assembly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref>B). Similarly, the side-by-side packing of the ARM/TPR<sup>&#x02217;</sup> units does not influence the peptide-binding site of the TPR domain. This structural organization would ensure that the connected TPR and UCS domains retain their functional independence in the oligomeric state, allowing the simultaneous docking of multiple client proteins and cooperating chaperones to the UNC-45 chain. As the hydrophobicity of the multimer interface is largely conserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C), we presume that the observed chaperone chain represents a common feature of the UNC-45 family. Deviations from this organization, as implicated by the crystal structures of UNC-45 from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>) and yeast She4 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Blobel, 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S4</xref>), may reflect different functional states or activities, respectively. For example, the DmUNC-45 was observed in monomeric form with an entirely flexible TPR domain that could not be localized in the electron density, whereas the dimeric yeast She4 that lacks a TPR domain is involved in promoting myosin-actin interactions rather than thick filament assembly (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Toi et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>UNC-45 Forms Short Chains in Solution</title><p>To directly monitor the predicted UNC-45 multimer in solution, we performed a SEC analysis varying protein concentration and buffer conditions. As we could not detect higher-order oligomers in these experiments, we next developed a specific assay to target transient interactions that may stabilize the UNC-45 chain. To this end, we applied a targeted photocrosslinking approach using the UV-inducible amino acid <italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine (<italic>p</italic>Bpa), which can be expressed at any specific position in the protein. To explore chain formation, we exchanged a glutamine close to the supposed filament interface by <italic>p</italic>Bpa (Q452B) and compared the crosslinking capability of the wild-type Q452B with several variants affecting the structure of the donor (ARM) and acceptor (TPR<sup>&#x02217;</sup>) sites of the UNC-45 chain. For this purpose, we used the &#x00394;TPR (&#x00394;1&#x02013;134), L121W, and V480R/V484R mutations as steric and electrostatic blocks, respectively, preventing UNC-45 chain formation.</p><p>The crosslinking experiments revealed that the wild-type protein can assemble multimers of different size, with the largest ones comprising at least five subunits. In contrast, mutating the filament interface abolished the formation of defined higher-order oligomers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>A and 5B). Consistent with the proposed filament structure, this experiment highlights the importance of residues Leu121, Val480, and Val484 in mediating UNC-45 multimerization in solution. Moreover, the photocrosslinking approach revealed that chain formation depends strongly on UNC-45 concentration, with the longer chains occurring only at elevated protein concentration. For example, in solution, UNC-45 tetramers started to accumulate upon incubating UNC-45 at 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M, but not at lower concentrations (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>). To ultimately confirm that the crystallographic filament interface is relevant in&#x000a0;vitro, we analyzed the SDS-PAGE bands of the different UNC-45 multimers by mass spectrometry (MS). Recorded MS spectra revealed that the UV-activated <italic>p</italic>Bpa452 crosslinks to the Lys131/Ile132/Lys133 sequence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>C). Moreover, the <italic>p</italic>Bpa452-131/132/133 crosslink was specifically observed in all wild-type oligomers (marked with an arrow, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A), whereas it was not detected in the wild-type monomer sample nor in the second dimer fraction resulting from unspecific crosslinking (marked with a circle, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>A). Strikingly, in the structure of the UNC-45 filament, Lys131 and Ile132 are the most adjacent residues of Gln452<sup>&#x02217;</sup> being situated 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;&#x000c5; next to its terminal carboxamide group, thus explaining the precisely defined crosslinking pattern of UNC-45 multimers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref>D). Taken together, the MS analysis of photocrosslinked UNC-45 oligomers unequivocally demonstrates that UNC-45 forms short protein chains in solution comprising two to at least five subunits, which associate in the same manner as observed in the crystal lattice.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Formation of UNC-45 Tandem Modules Promotes Organization of Muscle Sarcomeres</title><p>To evaluate the relevance of the UNC-45 multimer in supporting myofilament formation in&#x000a0;vivo, we analyzed the effect of expressing the &#x00394;TPR, L121W, and V480R/V484R interface mutations in <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> body wall muscles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>A). Given their similar potential in destabilizing UNC-45 chains in&#x000a0;vitro, we expected that the three transgenes would exhibit similar phenotypes in&#x000a0;vivo. Surprisingly, however, the V480R/V484R mutation showed the strongest effects and did not restore locomotion and sarcomere integrity of <italic>unc-45(m94)</italic> worms, as indicated by the low number of body bends and the completely disorganized sarcomere structure, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C). To address the underlying reason for the enhanced phenotype, we performed extensive pull-down experiments monitoring the interactions with the UNC-45 partner proteins. As detailed in the <xref rid="mmc2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Information</xref>, these experiments clearly showed that the V480R/V484R mutant hinders binding of the myosin substrate in addition to blocking chain formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>C&#x02013;6E and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). As the L121W and &#x00394;TPR mutations did&#x000a0;not abrogate myosin binding, they should reflect the consequence of impaired chain formation in the <italic>unc-45(m94)</italic> background more precisely. In contrast to wild-type UNC-45, the TPR mutations could not recover full motility of <italic>m94</italic> worms, as indicated by a 30%&#x02013;50% reduced activity in body-bend assays. Moreover, muscle sarcomeres could only be in part restored and exhibited local myosin assembly defects, as well as a reduced overall size (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>B and 6C and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Most notably, sarcomeres restored by L121W and &#x00394;TPR UNC-45 had fewer myosin-containing A bands, i.e., four to six instead of seven to eight bands seen in worms expressing wild-type UNC-45 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref>E and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>A and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>). Because this effect is not correlated with Hsp90 function (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaiser et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), the dis- and reorganization of muscle sarcomeres should&#x000a0;directly result from the impaired formation of UNC-45 chains.</p><p>To further substantiate the biological relevance of UNC-45 oligomerization for muscle function, we tested whether the interface mutations compromised sarcomere organization when expressed in wild-type worms. We observed that transgenes encoding the two site-specific chain mutations L121W and V480R/V484R caused a small but definite reduction in motility, whereas the &#x00394;TPR transgene caused the most pronounced locomotion defect, as would have been predicted from our structural model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F). Moreover, and consistent with the <italic>unc-45(m94)</italic> rescue experiments, the reduced motility was linked to a smaller number of A bands in the muscle sarcomere (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>F&#x02013;6H and <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4</xref>).

These data strongly support the UNC-45 chain model, as the interface mutants could directly interfere with forming UNC-45 scaffolding complexes, whereas the myosin binding capacity of wild-type UNC-45 cannot be compromised by the expressed myosin-binding mutants.</p><p><boxed-text id="dtbox1"><label>Extended Results</label><sec id="dtbox1sec1"><title>Choice of UNC-45 Residues for Addressing Myosin Binding In&#x000a0;Vivo</title><p>Owing to the pronounced homology to &#x003b2;-catenin, the UCS domain of UNC-45 is predicted to bind part of the myosin substrate in an extended conformation. As observed in &#x003b2;-catenin crystal structures (for example <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>), a series of histidine and asparagine residues that originate from adjacent H3 ARM helices anchor the peptide backbone of the substrate by several short-distanced hydrogen bonds. Notably, these main-chain binding sites are largely conserved among catenin and other ARM proteins (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Conti et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>). Our structural analysis suggests that this binding mode is also maintained in UNC-45 and relies on helix 13H3 (residues 748-761). This helix, which is highly conserved in the UCS protein family (Fig.S1C), composes the floor of the central passage of the UCS domain and is thus predicted to bind the core of potential substrate ligands. In analogy to &#x003b2;-catenin, the strictly conserved Asn758 should be critical for tethering the main-chain of the captured substrate, whereas the nearby Tyr750 contributes to the hydrophobic character of the outer rim of the UCS canyon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). Of note, UCS proteins express different hydrophobic residues at position 750 preferentially tyrosine and phenylalanine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>C, Fig.S1C). To test the catenin-based binding model, we replaced Asn758 of UNC-45 with a tyrosine residue that should abrogate the hydrogen-bonding to the substrate&#x02019;s peptide backbone and block the central passage of the UCS canyon. In parallel, we introduced a conservative mutation at position 750 by replacing tyrosine with tryptophan, which can in&#x000a0;silico obtain a similar arrangement within the UCS canyon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). In addition, we introduced a distinct steric block in the UCS canyon by deleting loop 602-630, the most characteristic signature motif of UCS proteins that is absent in other ARM proteins. Structural alignment with &#x003b2;-catenin complex structures suggests that this loop, which connects the two rims of the UCS canyon, may embrace the substrate protein. Therefore, deletion of residues 602-630 would shrink the opening of the UCS passage such that the binding site is interrupted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref>A). In addition, the &#x00394;602-630 mutant lacks highly conserved residues, which border the UCS canyon and may be directly involved in substrate binding. The in&#x000a0;vivo analysis of the Y750W, N758Y and &#x00394;602-630 mutations confirmed the postulated binding site and revealed that the UCS canyon observed in the <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> crystal structure is essential to interact with myosin.</p></sec><sec id="dtbox1sec2"><title>Assessing the In&#x000a0;Vivo Side Effects of the UNC-45 Interface Mutations</title><p>To address the formation of UNC-45 chains, we generated three distinct mutants affecting the two faces of the UNC-45 multimerization site formed by helices of the TPR domain (motif-1) and the neck domain (motif-2). Two mutants comprise site-specific exchanges in motif-1 (L121W) and motif-2 (V480R/V484R), respectively, whereas the &#x00394;TPR mutant lacks the entire motif-1. Though all three interface mutants blocked chain formation in&#x000a0;vitro, the structural data suggest that the &#x00394;TPR mutant should show the strongest effect in impairing UNC-45 oligomer function in&#x000a0;vivo. It is thus surprising that the double arginine mutant V480R/V484R exhibits the most pronounced defects and could not rescue the temperature-dependent locomotion phenotype of <italic>unc-45(m94) ts</italic> mutants, whereas expression of the two TPR transgenes (L121W and &#x00394;TPR) rescued motility at least partially.</p><p>To better understand the observed in&#x000a0;vivo phenotypes, we tested whether the interface mutations disturb, in addition, the interaction with partner proteins. Indeed, systematic UNC-45 pull-down experiments, which were carried out at different temperatures and using cell lysates from <italic>unc-45(m94)</italic> and wild-type worms revealed that the distinct mutations affect the binding of the myosin substrate to different degrees. Most strikingly, the V480R/V484R mutation impaired myosin binding under all conditions though the total myosin levels in the cells were not affected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;6</xref>D, Fig.S6BCD). Inspection of the crystal structure provides a possible explanation for this effect. The two residues Val480 and Val484 are located in close proximity to the opening of the myosin binding canyon (Fig.S6E) and thus inserting two bulky and positively charged arginine residues at this position may impede substrate binding. In contrast to the V480R/V484R mutant, the L121W and &#x00394;TPR mutants bound larger amounts of cellular myosin than the wild-type UNC-45. Because the corresponding TPR mutations are located far remote of the identified myosin binding site (Fig.S6E), an indirect effect should account for this observation. Notably, our in&#x000a0;vivo analyses revealed that worms expressing the TPR mutations have only half of the number of A-bands than wild-type worms, however, total myosin levels remained the same (Fig.S6C). We thus presume that a substantial fraction of the cellular myosin is not assembled in thick filaments, as part of the A-bands, and is therefore less stable. Though we could not directly compare levels of aggregated and filamentous myosin (both species contribute to the insoluble fraction of muscle cell lysates), our interpretation is corroborated by&#x000a0;recent publications reporting the reduced stability and aggregation of unassembled muscle myosin (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Kurapati et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Martinsson et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Tajsharghi and Oldfors, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Tajsharghi et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, the TPR mutants appear to retain the capability to interact with the myosin substrate, however in addition pull down unassembled, presumably aggregated myosin molecules.</p><p>In sum, the myosin coIP experiments suggest that the V480R/V484R mutation causes a profound side-effect in interfering with&#x000a0;substrate binding. Therefore, its strong in&#x000a0;vivo phenotype seems to result from two additive effects that include the weakened interaction with myosin on top of the impaired formation of UNC-45 chaperone chains. In contrast, the two TPR mutants&#x000a0;retained their ability to interact with myosin and should thus reflect the biological function of UNC-45 multimers more precisely.</p></sec></boxed-text></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the function of UNC-45 has been extensively studied, mechanistic insight of how UNC-45 promotes the assembly of myosin thick filaments and cooperates with the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones is still elusive (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Myhre and Pilgrim, 2012</xref>). In contrast to recent structural studies that revealed the folds of the central and UCS domains of yeast She4 (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Blobel, 2010</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> UNC-45 (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Lee et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), our structural, biochemical, and in&#x000a0;vivo data of <italic>C.&#x000a0;elegans</italic> UNC-45 uncover the atomic architecture of a filament assembly factor that itself forms a continuous, polar protein chain. Owing to its role in chaperoning and organizing myosin thick filaments, the UNC-45 multimer exhibits characteristic features that distinguish it from the few other protein filaments&#x02014;typically cytoskeletal filaments&#x02014;for which high-resolution structural data are available (<xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>). The UNC-45 oligomer has a relatively small interface that allows the rapid (dis)assembly of multimers comprising two to five subunits. Moreover, the chaperone chain is organized as a bipartite structure with a backbone formed by a series of ARM/TPR<sup>&#x02217;</sup> superhelices and attached functional protrusions mediating interactions with client proteins and partner chaperones.</p><p>Our data suggest that the UNC-45 multimer establishes a multisite docking platform licensing the Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones to act in a periodic pattern on the unfolded substrate. This UNC-45 manufacturing system is ideally suited for the assembly of a substrate protein like myosin that itself forms a polar filament. It allows a protein with a single Hsp70/Hsp90 binding motif to simultaneously recruit multiple chaperones and foster their side-by-side collaboration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>A). Given the different nature of the cooperating chaperones, Hsp70 and Hsp90 may either occupy alternating positions on the UNC-45 chain or bind sequentially to carry out early and late folding steps, respectively. Moreover, the UNC-45 tandem modules offer the proper spacing of about 170&#x000a0;&#x000c5; to work on dimeric myosin heads that protrude from the coiled-coil backbone of the thick filament with an overall periodicity of 145&#x000a0;&#x000c5; (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Craig and Woodhead, 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;7</xref>B). The slightly different spacing of UNC-45 and myosin might be overcome by the transient nature of UNC-45 multimers. According to our model, UNC-45 chains are not infinite in length but are, rather, organized as a series of short assembly lines that scaffold the dimeric myosin heads over short distances along the myofilament. Indeed, formation of stable UNC-45 filaments would cause severe problems in&#x000a0;vivo, as UNC-45 is implicated not only in muscle development, but also in maintaining myosin integrity during stress situations (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Etard et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>). Stably formed UNC-45 chains would hinder the relocation of the myosin chaperone within sarcomeric substructures and thus limit the functionality of UNC-45 during muscle development and maintenance.</p><p>Owing to its unique structural features, we propose that UNC-45 chains support the precise in-register arrangement of myosin head domains, which is a prerequisite for proper thick filament and sarcomere assembly. This previously undescribed molecular patterning function should mainly depend on the multimerization properties of UNC-45 and should thus underlie its autonomous role in sarcomere organization (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gaiser et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The biological significance of the polar chaperone chain described here is also supported by the fact that all organisms containing sarcomeric structures express UCS proteins harboring a TPR domain, which is an essential structural component for UNC-45 polymerization. As the residues contributing to the crystallographic filament interface are moderately conserved within this UCS protein family, we presume that UNC-45 chain formation might be a common principle important for myosin assembly and muscle formation. Direct experimental evidence for this function is provided by the dominant-negative effect of expressing UNC-45 interface mutations in wild-type worms. As predicted by our model, the sarcomere assembly defects could result from integrating interface mutants into cellular UNC-45 scaffolds, leading to the premature termination of myosin assembly chains. As the myosin-binding mutants did not exert this effect, substrate binding and chain formation seem to be two separate activities of UNC-45. Indeed, chain formation appears to be a highly dynamic process that depends on the amount of UNC-45 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;S5</xref>), which should be carefully controlled in the cell. Consistently, mutations in human p97, a ubiquitin-selective ATPase critical for the degradation of UNC45b, are directly linked to inclusion body myopathies (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Janiesch et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). The deleterious effect of elevated UNC-45 levels on sarcomere and thick filament integrity is further evidenced by UNC-45 overexpression studies in worms (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Hoppe et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Landsverk et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) and by the fact that human UNC45b is one of the most upregulated proteins in heart muscle tissues of humans who died of ischemic heart failure (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Stanley et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, Circulation, abstract). It will therefore be important to test which cellular factors and modifications influence UNC-45 chain formation and substrate recruitment.

(Top) UNC-45 (different domains indicated), its oligomers, Hsp70 (blue), and Hsp90 (lilac) represent the basic building blocks for the myosin multichaperone complex. (Bottom) UNC-45 chains compose a molecular scaffold that allows the simultaneous binding of Hsp70, Hsp90, and myosin, thus mediating the interactions between unfolded myosin and its cognate chaperones.

The observed periodicity between UNC-45 tandem modules (170&#x000a0;&#x000c5;) fits well to the observed spacing between protomers of adjacent myosin pairs (110 to 220&#x000a0;&#x000c5;, derived from PDB code 3dtp), as schematically shown in the enlarged window (myosin in green with orange circles symbolizing equal segments in the asymmetric dimer).

Interacting residues are labeled. To describe the specific contacts with UNC-45, we will focus on the interaction with the Hsp90 peptide, which is numbered in descending order with the C-terminal Asp0 preceded by Val-1, Glu-2, Glu-3, Met-4, Arg-5, Ser-6 and Ala-7. The Hsp90 C terminus is tethered in a bent conformation to the TPR domain undergoing multiple main-chain and side-chain interactions with highly conserved UNC-45 residues. Contacting residues of the TPR domain are highlighted in green and are labeled. Contacts to the backbone are mediated by Lys82 and Arg86 that bind to the carbonyl oxygen of Glu-2, by Asp114 that interacts with the amine nitrogen of Met-4 and finally by Arg12, Asn16 and Asn52 that compose a positively charged pocket to accommodate the carboxy-terminus of Hsp90. Notably, the geometry of the three backbone anchor points favors binding of the Hsp90 peptide in bent conformation. The observed turn structure is further stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond between the side chains of Glu-2 and Ser-6. All remaining side-chains of the Hsp90 peptide are engaged in interactions with highly conserved TPR residues ensuring the tight and specific binding of the Hsp90 C-terminal peptide. The carboxylate group of Asp0 is tightly bound by Arg51 and Lys82, the Val-1 side chain is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket lined by residues Val19, Asn52 and Met55, Glu-3 forms a short-distanced salt-bridge with the amino group of Lys59 and the side-chain of Met-4 protrudes into a deep hydrophobic pocket bordered by Val81, Lys82, Phe85 and Ile117. <italic>Right panel</italic>: Eight residues of the Hsp90 peptide ligand (ASRMEEVD lilac) and ten residues of the Hsp70 peptide ligand (AGGPTIEEVD blue) are well-defined by electron density revealing their precise binding mode.

The 602-630 loop of CeUNC-45 extends as unfolded segment into the protein periphery, whereas in the crystal structure of DmUNC-45, this loop folds back on the UCS domain filling partly the extended central canyon (shown in orange). We presume that the different domain organization and oligomeric states observed in the crystal structures of DmUNC-45 and She4 are due to different crystal contacts and the introduction of multiple mutations for protein crystallization, respectively.</p><p>(B) CeUNC-45 was crystallized in space group P6<sub>1</sub>22 having a single molecule in the asymmetric unit (unit cell dimensions are indicated). Six UNC-45 dimers related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis are sitting in a 6<sub>1</sub>-screw axis on top of each other thus yielding the long c-axis of 815&#x000a0;&#x000c5;. Each of the 12 molecules undergoes longitudinal interactions with their crystallographic neighbors (shown for top molecule) resulting in polar UNC-45 chains that extend with a 85&#x000a0;&#x000c5; periodicity throughout the crystal, perpendicularly to the long crystallographic c-axis. In contrast to the filament interface, the crystallographic dimer is largely stabilized by polar interactions as shown in the close-up window.</p><p>(C) DmUNC-45 was crystallized in space group P23 with a single subunit in the asymmetric unit. Owing to crystal symmetry, twelve molecules associate via their UCS domains forming a hollow sphere that is surrounded by six couples of central domains. Side-by-side packing of the DmUNC-45 spheres generates a wide-meshed crystal lattice with huge holes, into which the flexible TPR domains (indicated by green spheres) protrude. Whether the en-bloc flexibility of the TPR domain is functionally relevant or influenced by crystal packing remains to be shown.</p><p>(D) She4, a yeast UCS protein that is proposed to promote actin-myosin interactions (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Shi and Blobel, 2010</xref>), was crystallized upon introducing 13 point mutations and deleting loop 343-358 (indicated by red circles). In the crystal lattice, two She4 molecules associate to generate an S-shaped dimer that is stabilized by the N-terminal helix binding to the neck domain (ARM repeats 8-9) of a molecular neighbor. It still needs to be experimentally shown that the crystallographic dimer is functionally relevant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="figs4"/></fig><fig id="figs5"><label>Figure&#x000a0;S5</label><caption><p>Concentration Dependency of UNC-45 Oligomer Formation, Related to <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;5</xref></p><p>(A) SDS-PAGE analysis of the photo-crosslinking reaction upon <italic>p</italic>Bpa452 activation.
