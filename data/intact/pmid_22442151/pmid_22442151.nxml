We previously showed that TG2 has a strong affinity for heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin and reported that the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-4 acts as a receptor for TG2 via its HS chains in two ways: by increasing TG2-cell surface trafficking/externalization and by mediating RGD-independent cell adhesion to fibronectin-TG2 matrix during wound healing. Here we have investigated the molecular basis of this interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that either mutation of basic RRWK (262&#x02013;265) or KQKRK (598&#x02013;602) clusters, forming accessible heparin binding sequences on the TG2 three-dimensional structure, led to an almost complete reduction of heparin binding, indicating that both clusters contribute to form a single binding surface. Mutation of residues Arg<sup>19</sup> and Arg<sup>28</sup> also led to a significant reduction in heparin binding, suggesting their involvement. Our findings indicate that the heparin binding sites on TG2 mainly comprise two clusters of basic amino acids, which are distant in the linear sequence but brought into spatial proximity in the folded &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; protein, forming a high affinity heparin binding site. Molecular modeling showed that the identified site can make contact with a single heparin-derived pentasaccharide. The TG2-heparin binding mutants supported only weak RGD-independent cell adhesion compared with wild type TG2 or mutants with retained heparin binding, and both heparin binding clusters were critical for TG2-mediated cell adhesion. These findings significantly advance our knowledge of how HS/heparin influences the adhesive function of TG2.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cell Adhesion</kwd><kwd>Extracellular Matrix</kwd><kwd>Fibronectin</kwd><kwd>Heparan Sulfate</kwd><kwd>Heparin</kwd><kwd>Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans</kwd><kwd>Open Transglutaminase-2</kwd><kwd>Syndecan-4</kwd><kwd>Transglutaminase-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Transglutaminase type 2 (TG2)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN4"><sup>3</sup></xref> (EC 2.3.2.13) belongs to an emerging category of proteins with distinct molecular activities that function both inside and outside the cell and transit the plasma membrane by unconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Outside the cell TG2 regulates the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and modulates cell-ECM adhesion and outside-in signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), whereas in the intracellular environment TG2 participates into signaling events leading to regulation of cell survival, particularly in response to cell wounding, hypoxia, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). TG2 is ubiquitously expressed and plays a pleiotropic role in a variety of pathophysiological conditions related to tissue remodeling including cancer development, organ fibrosis, and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Protein transamidation, leading to &#x003f5;(&#x003b3;-glutamyl)lysine intra- or intermolecular isopeptide bonds (&#x0201c;protein cross-links&#x0201d;), is the enzymatic reaction for which TG2 is better recognized, which is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and guanine nucleotide dissociation, a condition favored in the extracellular environment or after cell injury and loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Furthermore, TG2-mediated protein deamidation of Gln residues contributes to the adaptive immunoresponse induced in gluten sensitivity diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In the intracellular environment TG2 can serve as a an unconventional GTPase whose GTP binding and hydrolysis site is integrated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated transamidase active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In the ECM the role of TG2 is largely linked to its interaction with fibronectin, which occurs via the N-terminal &#x003b2;-sandwich domain of TG2, leading to cell-matrix adhesion, cell migration, and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The extracellular function of TG2 only partly depends on protein cross-linking (<italic>e.g.</italic> leading to fibronectin remodeling). TG2 supports adhesion-mediated cell signaling through a well described non-enzymatic function by acting as a cell surface integrin-&#x003b2;1 co-receptor for fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) or by ligating syndecan-4 (sdc-4) receptor once deposited in the ECM in a TG2-fibronectin heterocomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>TG2 contributes to the regulation of extracellular and intracellular events. However, how TG2 dual location may be coordinated to allow for flexibility of localization/function and how the balance between catalytically active and inactive TG2 is maintained in the extracellular environment remains to be clarified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). It has been recently proposed that TG2 is externalized via recycling endosomes in which it is delivered by binding to phospholipids and an unknown endosomal receptor(s), based on a model of fibroblasts expressing exogenous TG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In our laboratory we previously identified a strong affinity of TG2 for heparan sulfate (HS) glycosoaminoglycans and its association with the aforementioned HS proteoglycan receptor sdc-4. We demonstrated that the HS chains of sdc-4 have a dual role in regulating TG2 function; that is, by controlling the cell surface trafficking/ECM distribution of TG2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> during experimental kidney fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and by mediating RGD-independent cell adhesion induced by matrix TG2 in heterocomplex with fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). This alternative cell adhesion pathway complements the classic integrin-dependent RGD pathway, leading to RGD-independent activation of protein kinase C&#x003b1;, focal adhesion kinase, and ERK1/2 protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This process is particularly relevant in situations of cell damage/matrix fragmentation and increased deposition of TG2 in the matrix once integrin-mediated signaling is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Heparan sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) glycosoaminoglycans are well recognized regulators of cell functions by acting as signaling co-receptors, modulators of tissue distribution, and cellular trafficking for a variety of molecules. HS is a complex polysaccharide consisting of disaccharide units and is linked to specific cell surface proteins (<italic>e.g.</italic> the aforementioned syndecans and glypicans) and ECM proteins (agrin, perlecan, collagen XVIII). The HS chains consist of alternating <italic>N</italic>-acetylated or <italic>N</italic>-sulfated glucosamine units (GlcNAc or <italic>N</italic>-sulfoglucosamine) and uronic acids (glucuronic acid or iduronic acid). The assembly of HS chains on core proteins is characterized by great variability and processing reactions (GlcNac <italic>N</italic>-deacetylation, <italic>N</italic>-sulfation, epimerization, and <italic>O</italic>-sulfation), which progress at different extents to generate patterns of highly negatively charged binding sites responsible for binding to a variety of protein ligands (among which fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/FGF receptor is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>)).</p><p>Although the crystallographic structure of TG2 has been defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), the heparin binding site in TG2 has not been determined. Given the potential key role of HS proteoglycans in controlling the trafficking and the extracellular adhesive functions of TG2 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have begun investigating the nature of this interaction. In this study we have mapped a high affinity heparin binding site on TG2 and showed that it comprises two distant clusters of basic amino acids that are brought into close proximity on the folded protein. We have also shown that the identified heparin binding site is critical for cell adhesion to TG2-fibronectin matrix. These data significantly advance our knowledge of how HS/heparin interacts with and influences the adhesive function of TG2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Protein Expression, Purification, and Analysis</title><p>Human TG2 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) was subcloned into pET21a(+) (Novagen) between NheI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites (pET21a(+)TG2).

All the TG2 mutants were expressed at milligram levels with purity similar to wt TG2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.337089/DC1">supplemental Fig. 1</ext-link>). To test whether the TG2 mutants retained the typical transamidating activity of TG2, which is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and regulated by guanine nucleotides, we measured the Ca<sup>2+</sup> requirement for the mutants compared with wt TG2. Dose-response curves for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation were obtained by increasing the concentration of added Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0&#x02013;5 m<sc>m</sc>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>).

Wt TG2 reached half-maximal activation at &#x0223c;90 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant differences in EC<sub>50</sub> for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation between wt TG2 and the mutants except for M1a (Arg<sup>262</sup>), M1b (Arg<sup>263</sup>), and M7 (Lys<sup>634</sup>), which reached &#x0223c;30&#x02013;40% activity at the EC<sub>50</sub> (Ca<sup>2+)</sup> of wt TG2. However, only M1b displayed a significantly lower level of specific activity than the wt enzyme at saturating levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The GTP inhibition of wt and mutant TG2 was evaluated in the presence of 150 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> Ca<sup>2+</sup> (which corresponds to &#x0223c;70% of maximum activity of wt TG2). GTP was capable of inhibiting all the mutant enzymes similarly to wt TG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>), with only M1a (Arg<sup>262</sup>) and M4 (Arg-19) being slightly more and less sensitive, respectively, to GTP inhibition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

It can be concluded that all these mutations do not disrupt the bifunctional property of TG2, indicating that the proteins were properly folded. Thermal shift analysis showed that the TG2 mutants had very similar stability to wt TG2, a finding that is consistent with their correct folding (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.337089/DC1">supplemental Fig. 2</ext-link>).

This system mimicked to some extent the cell membrane-anchored proteoglycan, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was used to measure changes in the refractive index caused by the interaction that occurred when TG2 was flowed across the immobilized heparin surface. Dose-response experiments were performed with the wt TG2 injected in the 66&#x02013;500 n<sc>m</sc> range. The association phase (from 100 to 400 s) was allowed to proceed to equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>), and affinity data were derived as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; This returned an affinity of <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = 181 n<sc>m</sc>. As heparin is heterogeneous in sequence and is thus likely to display different binding sites, the above calculated value should be regarded as an &#x0201c;average affinity&#x0201d; constant. Nevertheless, this indicated a relatively strong affinity between TG2 and heparin. Next, the same assay was used to determine the binding strength of the different TG2 mutants. Each of the residues of the first BBXB cluster (Arg<sup>262</sup>, Arg<sup>263</sup>, and Lys<sup>265</sup>) was found critically important for heparin recognition, as none of the corresponding mutants (M1a, M1b, and M1c) strongly bound to the immobilized glycosoaminoglycan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>B&#x02013;D</italic>). Similarly, the mutant corresponding to the second cluster (M3; KQKRK) was strongly impaired in its ability to bind heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>E</italic>). Then, to investigate whether residues Arg<sup>19</sup> and Arg<sup>28</sup>, both located close to the above-analyzed residues, could be part of the binding site, the TG2 mutants (M4 and M5) corresponding to these two residues were injected over the heparin surface. Although these mutants still interacted with heparin, they both displayed defects in heparin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>F</italic> and <italic>G</italic>). The TG2 mutant M7, corresponding to residue Lys<sup>634</sup>, bound very well to heparin but at a much lower rate, as equilibrium was not reached after the 5-min association phase, compared with wt TG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>H</italic>), supporting its involvement in heparin recognition. Finally, we also analyzed the effect of two additional mutants, the M2 mutant (Lys<sup>202</sup>, Lys<sup>205</sup>) whose mutated residues are located on the opposite face of the protein, and the M6 mutant (Arg<sup>580</sup>). Both displayed strong binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>, <italic>I</italic> and <italic>J</italic>), returning affinity values of 162 n<sc>m</sc> for M2 and 189 n<sc>m</sc> for M6, thus, virtually identical to that of the wt protein.

The average values are similar to the ones observed in many heparin-bound crystal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), and the deviations are mostly on the &#x003c8; angle, in agreement with the previously calculated energy maps of the heparin disaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). The bound conformations present, therefore, some flexibility ranging from a fully extended shape to a curved shape.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><italic>A</italic>, shown is superposition of the accessible surface of TG2 with five docked pentasaccharides selected among the 16 with higher GLIDE scores and representing the range of available conformations. <italic>B</italic>, selection of one pose among the 16 best ones with representation of hydrogen bonds to basic amino acids is shown. <italic>C</italic>, shown is the total number of hydrogen bonds for the 16 best poses as a function of the involved carbohydrate sulfate group and protein amino acid.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0221208310005"/></fig><p>The solution displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref><italic>B</italic> has been selected among the Glide high scores on the basis of its strong interaction with basic amino acids and its extended shape.

Cell binding to TG2-fibronectin requires a direct interaction of TG2 with the HS chains of sdc-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). It is, therefore, anticipated that ligation of cell surface sdc-4 by the heparin binding site of TG2 would be required. Having identified the heparin-binding site within TG2, we investigated the effects of its mutation in TG2-mediated RGD-independent cell adhesion. For these studies we used Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts as a cell model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Among the heparin binding mutant TG2 proteins, we tested M1c, corresponding to the first BBXB cluster (Lys<sup>265</sup>), and M3, corresponding to the second heparin binding cluster BXBBB (Lys<sup>598</sup>/Lys<sup>600</sup>/Arg<sup>601</sup>/Lys<sup>602</sup>). As showed earlier in this study, these mutants had no residual heparin binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>) and were biochemically very similar to the wt enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). We also included TG2 mutants with retained heparin binding properties, M2, corresponding to Lys<sup>202</sup>/Lys<sup>205</sup>, and M6, corresponding to Arg<sup>580</sup>. wt and mutant TG2 proteins were allowed to associate with fibronectin as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Measurements of TG2 bound to fibronectin by an ELISA-type assay showed similar fibronectin associations between wt and mutant TG2 proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M111.337089/DC1">supplemental Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></ext-link>). Next, cells were allowed to adhere on fibronectin alone or fibronectin supplemented with either wt or mutant TG2 proteins, in the presence of competitive concentrations of soluble RGD peptide or control inactive RAD peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref>, by blocking fibronectin binding to &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrins, the RGD peptide significantly reduced cell attachment and spreading on fibronectin (FN) to &#x0223c;50% that of the control value (FN with or without RAD peptide). In contrast, the RGD peptide did not significantly compete with &#x003b1;<sub>5</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin-cell attachment and spreading when cells were seeded on fibronectin in complex with wt TG2 (FN-TG2), which was conducive of RGD-independent cell adhesion, as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, when cells were allowed to adhere on fibronectin in complex with the heparin binding TG2 mutants (FN-M1c and FN-M3) in the presence of RGD peptide, cells only reached &#x0223c;half the control cell attachment and spreading values (FN with or without RAD peptide). The TG2 mutants with retained heparin binding (FN-M2 and FN-M6) still supported RGD-independent cell adhesion. In conclusion, the heparin binding TG2 mutants M1c and M3 failed to compensate the loss of RGD dependence in terms of number of attached cells and cytosolic morphology. The result shows that the heparin binding site of TG2 that we have identified is responsible for stimulating RGD-independent cell adhesion.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>RGD-independent cell adhesion of wt TG2 and TG2 heparin binding mutants.</bold> Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were allowed to adhere either on FN alone or FN supplemented with wt or mutant TG2 (heparin binding mutants M1c and M3; mutants with retained heparin-binding M2 and M6) in serum-free medium for 20 min as described under &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures.&#x0201d; Where indicated cells were preincubated with competitive concentrations of soluble GRGDTP peptide or control GRADSP peptide (100 &#x003bc;g/ml).

We conclude that within the fibronectin-TG2 heterocomplex, TG2 bears an inactive conformation with retained heparin binding.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>There is evidence that HS proteoglycans mediate the biological activity of TG2 in at least two ways; first, by controlling TG2 cell surface trafficking and externalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and second, by acting as cell surface adhesion receptors for TG2 once it is released and deposited in a heterocomplex with FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). As an increased externalization of TG2 has been implicated in several different pathologies, investigating the nature of the TG2-HS association is important to assist in determining its physiological role <italic>in vivo</italic> and to allow the rational control of this interaction. We have previously reported that TG2 interacts with HS or its highly sulfated analog heparin strongly, with low nanomolar <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Here we have investigated the nature of the binding site and characterized, for the first time, the residues involved in this interaction.</p><p>Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of TG2 protein revealed clusters of positively charged amino acids on the TG2 surface forming typical heparin binding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and spatially close individual basic amino acids that are potentially accessible by HS chains. Testing these positions of possible HS binding by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that mutation of basic cluster KQKRK (598&#x02013;602) was associated with an almost complete reduction of heparin binding (Biacore analysis) compared with the wt enzyme. It also showed that mutation of the individual basic residues Arg<sup>262</sup>, Arg<sup>263</sup>, and Lys<sup>265</sup>, forming a second positively charged RRWK cluster (262&#x02013;265), was sufficient to lead to a large reduction in heparin binding. Mutation of basic residues Arg<sup>19</sup> and Arg<sup>28</sup>, which in the crystal structure are located next to the two above-mentioned clusters, also led to a significant reduction in heparin binding, suggesting their involvement. Mutation of Lys<sup>634</sup>, which is also spatially closed to these two clusters, led to a slower rate of binding to heparin, showing the involvement of this further residue in heparin interaction. In contrast, neither Lys<sup>202</sup> and Lys<sup>205</sup> residues nor the GTP binding site Arg<sup>580</sup>, which constitutes further accessible basic sites, was shown to participate in heparin binding.</p><p>Our study has led us to conclude that the heparin binding site on TG2 mainly comprises two clusters of basic amino acids, the RRWK (262&#x02013;265) and the KQKRK (598&#x02013;602). These two positive clusters are distant in the linear sequence; however, they are brought into spatial proximity on the folded closed protein, forming the heparin binding site. In this conformation TG2 is typically bound to guanine or adenine nucleotide and its active site (Cys<sup>277</sup>-His<sup>335</sup>-Asp<sup>358</sup> catalytic triad) is obscured as a result of guanine nucleotide or adenine nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>).</p><p>In its active conformation, which was resolved on TG2 bound to irreversible active-site inhibitors, Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding involves a large conformational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Although in the folded conformation the two positive sequences, RRWK (262&#x02013;265) and KQKRK (598&#x02013;602), are spatially close, in the open active conformation they are spatially distant. Based on the finding that mutations in these individual clusters very strongly impaired heparin binding and, thus, that they both contribute to form a single binding surface, it could be concluded that the open form has a reduced heparin binding affinity compared with the closed conformation. We tested this hypothesis and found that the open TG2 form displayed a strongly reduced ability to bind to heparin compared with the closed one. This finding supports the view that TG2 features two independent heparin binding sites, which are brought into close proximity in the closed protein, forming a large interacting basic surface, which is destroyed by the opening of the structure. This result is also consistent with the fact that mutations in a single domain are sufficient to knock down heparin binding. However, such a drastic effect of a single point mutation on heparin binding has been observed already, for example, in the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1, where two single mutations were each able to almost fully inhibit HS recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>We have also shown that a single heparin-derived pentasaccharide has the length required to make contacts with the residues of the two basic clusters, RRWK (262&#x02013;265) and KQKRK (598&#x02013;602), of TG2 in the closed conformation. <italic>In vivo</italic> HS are present as syndecan or glypican receptors at the cell surface and perlecans in the basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Further studies will be necessary to identify the HS sequences interacting with TG2 and whether the nature of the HS chains composition and their tissue concentration affects the trafficking/biological activity of TG2 in different cell compartments.</p><p>TG2 is mostly regarded as a latent enzyme whose activity is kept under tight control to prevent excessive post-translational modifications of protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). A demonstration of this is given by the comparable level of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent TG2 transamidation obtained from conditioned matrices with low levels of TG2 and matrices with high levels of TG2, suggesting that TG activity is transient and it is down-regulated by matrix sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). There is a clear mechanism of TG2 regulation inside the cells, as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent transamidation is allosterically inhibited by guanine nucleotide binding and a low Ca<sup>2+</sup>-nucleotide ratio. However, outside the cell where TG2 is potentially constantly activated by high (millimolar) concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> resulting into a high Ca<sup>2+</sup>-nucleotide ratio, the mechanism of TG2 regulation it is less clear. Oxidation of TG2 and formation of critical disulfide bonds may contribute to its extracellular regulation causing loss of TG2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>), which can be restored by reducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). It has also been suggested that nitrosylation of TG2 via NO may contribute to its transition between active enzyme and &#x0201c;structural matrix protein&#x0201d; with no required transamidating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>). It could be speculated that short <italic>N</italic>-sulfoglucosamine-enriched HS sequences, bridging the RRWK (262&#x02013;265) and KQKRK (598&#x02013;602) sites, could stabilize the closed form and that high calcium concentrations might indeed partially disrupt the complex and thus favor the transition toward the open active form. In this way the interaction with HS may regulate TG2 activity depending on Ca<sup>2+</sup>/HS microenvironment. An example of regulation of enzymatic activity by HS and ionic changes was previously reported for elastase and cathepsin G, which are stored in an inactive form, bound to HS proteoglycans within neutrophil granules, and released in an active form by an increase of ionic strength (K<sup>+</sup> ions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Thus, regulation of TG2 activity in the extracellular environment may be linked to structural changes brought about by HS proteoglycans structures and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. We previously suggested that HSs regulate the cell surface trafficking of TG2 as the absence of cell surface HS or cells with targeted deletion of sdc-4 do not effectively externalize TG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). As described for FGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), HS may be effective in trapping and anchoring leaderless TG2 once exported to the cell surface. In this scenario, the activating concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular space could destabilize the closed form and the HS interaction, leading to the &#x0201c;release&#x0201d; of active TG2. Therefore, binding of TG2 to HS via the identified binding site may be another level of control for extracellular TG2 and have widespread biological consequences/implications, particularly in the context of cell adhesion, tissue fibrosis, and cancer progression.</p><p>We know that matrix TG2 when in heterocomplex with fibronectin supports RGD-independent cell adhesion through ligation of the HS chains of sdc-4. In this study we have shown that mutant forms of TG2 lacking either of the two identified heparin binding clusters supported only weak RGD-independent cell adhesion compared with wt TG2 or TG2 mutants with retained heparin binding properties. This finding suggests the requirement for both heparin binding clusters, RRWK (262&#x02013;265) and KQKRK (598&#x02013;602), for TG2-mediated cell adhesion. It also substantiates evidence that the cell surface receptor for matrix TG2 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, corroborating the knowledge that HS chains regulate the biological function of TG2 at many levels. Although we do not know which conformation TG2 assumes in heterocomplex with fibronectin, we have confirmed that TG2 becomes a catalytically inactive &#x0201c;structural&#x0201d; protein, which we conclude retains heparin binding.</p><p>Multiple alignments of the human, mouse, and rat TG2 protein have revealed that the two positive clusters forming the heparin binding site in the human TG2 sequence are mostly conserved, with the exception of Lys<sup>600</sup>, within the KQKRK (598&#x02013;602) motif, which is a neutral amino acid (Asn) in rat and mouse TG2. Among the other contributing residues, Arg<sup>19</sup> is conserved among the different species, but residue Arg<sup>28</sup> is a neutral Gln in rat and mouse TG2. Sequence alignments of human TG1, TG2, TG3, TG4, TG5, TG6, TG7, and FXIIIa revealed no obvious homology of the heparin binding sites with consensus <italic>X</italic>BB<italic>X</italic>B<italic>X</italic> and <italic>X</italic>BBB<italic>XX</italic>B<italic>X</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) identified in TG2, with the exception of KQKRK (598&#x02013;602) in TG3, which is replaced by another positive cluster (RVRK), and the basic residue Arg-19, which is conserved in TG1. Our preliminary observations (Biacore analysis) indicate that among the TG family members we have analyzed, only TG2 and TG1 bind heparin with high affinity (TG3 and FXIIIa have low heparin binding affinity). Because the full site is not conserved in TG1, we conclude that TG2 has a unique heparin binding site within the family of transglutaminases that could be specifically targeted to control the TG2-HS interaction.</p><p>In summary, we have mapped high affinity heparin binding sites on TG2 that are brought into close proximity on the folded protein and demonstrated that they influence RGD-independent cell adhesion mediated by TG2-fibronectin heterocomplex. These data have provided novel insights into the molecular nature of HS/heparin interaction with TG2 creating new a hypothesis on how heparan sulfate proteoglycans could regulate the extracellular function of TG2.</p></sec>
