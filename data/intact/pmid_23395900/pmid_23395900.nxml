This tripartite ring-shaped molecule is involved in holding replicated sister chromatids together from S phase until anaphase onset. Establishment of stable cohesion involves acetylation of the Smc3 component of cohesin during replication by the Eco1 acetyltransferase. This has been proposed to antagonise the activity of another member of the cohesin complex, Wpl1. Here, we describe the X-ray structure of the conserved Wapl domain, and demonstrate that it binds the ATPase head of the Smc3 protein. We present data that suggest that Wpl1 may be involved in regulating the ATPase activity of cohesin, and that this may be subject to the acetylation state of Smc3. In addition, we present a structure of the Wapl domain bound to a functionally relevant segment of the Smc3 ATPase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="hidden-editorial-summary"><title>Structural insights into the regulation of cohesion establishment by Wpl1</title><p>The conserved Wapl domain provides the first crystal structure of an associated regulator of the cohesin complex, and new insights into its interaction with cohesin core subunits.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>cohesion</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>Wpl1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Correct chromosome segregation in eukaryotes is ensured by physically linking duplicated sister chromatids during the S phase of the cell cycle and maintaining this connection until anaphase onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>). The linkage between sister chromatids is maintained by the ring-shaped cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Haering et al, 2008</xref>), which is loaded onto chromosomes in late G1 phase and activated in a multi-step, replication-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Skibbens et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">T&#x000f3;th et al, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Skibbens, 2009</xref>). The core of the cohesin complex consists of three proteins, Smc1, Smc3, and Scc1. Smc1 and Smc3 are members of the <underline>S</underline>tructural <underline>M</underline>aintenance of <underline>C</underline>hromosomes family and contain a globular ABC ATPase domain connected to a dimer-forming hinge domain by long intramolecular coiled coils, which are proposed to entrap sister DNA strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hirano, 2002</xref>). Scc1 is a member of the kleisin family of proteins that bridges the ATPase heads of the Smc1&#x02013;Smc3 ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Schleiffer et al, 2003</xref>). Proteolytic cleavage of this subunit by separase at anaphase onset allows release and poleward movement of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Uhlmann et al, 2000</xref>). In budding yeast, all chromosome-bound cohesin is removed at this point. In vertebrates, by contrast, the bulk of cohesin is removed from chromosomes during prophase in a proteolysis-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Losada et al, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Waizenegger et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Sumara et al, 2002</xref>), while centromeric cohesin is protected until anaphase by the protein Sgo1, at which point it is proteolytically released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kitajima et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Salic et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Tang et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">McGuinness et al, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Prior to DNA replication, cohesin binds chromatin in a reversible manner that is not capable of maintaining cohesion and is thought to be held in this state by a complex containing the proteins Wpl1 and Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Tanaka et al, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gandhi et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kueng et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ben-Shahar et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rowland et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sutani et al, 2009</xref>), whose activity is antagonised by Eco1-mediated acetylation of the Smc3 protein during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ivanov et al, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bellows et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Lengronne et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ben-Shahar et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Unal et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Zhang et al, 2008</xref>). In vertebrates, the stably chromatin-bound form of cohesin may be maintained by the binding of the protein sororin to Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Schmitz et al, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Nishiyama et al, 2010</xref>) though it is unclear if this system is conserved in yeast.</p><p>The <italic>Wapl</italic> gene was initially identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a controller of heterochromatin structure and cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Vern&#x000ec; et al, 2000</xref>). Subsequent studies in vertebrates have shown that the protein is involved in the non-proteolytic removal of cohesin during the prophase pathway as well as interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gandhi et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kueng et al, 2006</xref>). Wapl shows homology to the budding yeast Rad61 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Game et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Warren et al, 2004</xref>) which, when mutated, allows bypass of lethality associated with Eco1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ben-Shahar et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Unal et al, 2008</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that Wapl is involved in the destabilisation of chromatin-bound cohesin in an acetylation-dependent manner, and that budding yeast Rad61 (now also known as Wpl1) mediates a similar process. Currently, the molecular mechanisms of this complex pathway are not fully understood. In this paper, we present results of structural and biochemical studies of the Wpl1 protein. We describe the structure of the conserved domain of the Wpl1 protein, and present a biochemical analysis of its interactions with other members of the cohesin complex, which provides new insights into the process of cohesin establishment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure of the Wapl domain</title><p>All Wapl orthologues contain a C-terminal conserved domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>), which defines the family. This domain is &#x0223c;45&#x02009;kDa in size, and was predicted to be predominantly &#x003b1;-helical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kueng et al, 2006</xref>). The non-conserved N-terminal of the protein is highly divergent in both length and composition, and is responsible for mediating interactions with Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Shintomi and Hirano, 2009</xref>). Secondary structure predictions of the protein suggest that this divergent N-terminal is likely to be intrinsically disordered, so we decided to further investigate the structure of the conserved C-terminal Wapl domain. We identified a truncation of the Wpl1 protein from <italic>Ashbya gossypii</italic> (transcript AAR187C) comprising the Wapl domain that yielded high-quality crystals. The <italic>A. gossypii</italic> Wpl1 (AgWpl1) protein is fractionally shorter than budding yeast equivalent, but shows a high degree of similarity and 24&#x00025; identity over the entire sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). The final construct crystallised contained residues 184&#x02013;561 of AgWpl1, corresponding to residues 271&#x02013;635 of budding yeast Wpl1 (ScWpl1). High quality diffraction data were obtained to a resolution of 2.1&#x02009;&#x000c5;, and the structure was determined using multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction of a selenomethionine-substituted derivative. Statistics relating to the X-ray analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. The majority of the peptide chain is clearly defined in the electron density, with only short breaks between residues 544&#x02013;548 (chain A) and 189&#x02013;194, 214&#x02013;221, 311&#x02013;312 (chain B). The overall model refinement statistics are appropriate to the resolution of the experimental data.</p><p>The Wapl domain forms an elongated, peanut-shaped structure of &#x0223c;90 &#x000d7; 35&#x02009;&#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). The fold is defined by 20 consecutive &#x003b1;-helices and may be divided into 3 subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Domain 1 (residues 189&#x02013;220) forms an anti-parallel helical &#x02018;cap' to the structure, and is followed by six HEAT repeats that form the central domain of the protein. The C-terminal lobe (domain 3, residues 420&#x02013;561) is composed of a flattened 4-helix bundle capped by two anti-parallel helices at the extreme C-terminal. Three-dimensional homology searches performed using the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Holm and Sander, 1993</xref>) readily identify the central HEAT core of the protein and the Wapl repeats may be aligned to those of human PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Groves et al, 1999</xref>) with a C&#x003b1; r.m.s. deviation of 3.9&#x02009;&#x000c5; over 72 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>). No obvious structural homologues to domains 1 and 3 were identified. The topology of the helices in these domains is the same as in the HEAT repeat, but the three-dimensional structure has substantially diverged from the basic repeat architecture. An unusual feature of the structure is an insertion of a long helix and connecting loop (residues 301&#x02013;329) into repeat HEAT3 that projects away from the main body of the protein, somewhat like an opposable thumb against a palm formed by domain 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis of the electrostatic surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1E</xref>) showed that the N-terminal domain is highly charged with prominent acidic and basic patches, while the C-terminal domain is generally acidic or uncharged. Mapping sequence conservation onto the molecular surface identifies regions of particular interest, two corresponding to the charged patches in the N-lobe of the protein, and a conserved hydrophobic patch on the inner face of the C-terminal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1F</xref>). Based on our structural analyses and multiple sequence alignments of the Wapl domain, we have defined five sequence motifs that constitute these three surface features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Motifs 1 and 2 form the N-terminal acidic and basic regions, while motifs 3, 4, and 5 form the C-terminal hydrophobic patch.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Screening for interactions between the Wapl domain and the cohesin complex</title><p>It has previously been shown that Wapl directly interacts with Pds5 in both yeast and vertebrates via the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Gandhi et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kueng et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Shintomi and Hirano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sutani et al, 2009</xref>), but the function of the conserved C-terminal domain was unknown. We therefore decided to analyse the interactions between this domain and other proteins in the cohesin complex in more detail. To identify putative interacting partners, we performed a screen against a membrane peptide array comprising the AgSmc1 and AgSmc3 ATPase heads and AgScc1. The arrays consisted of 21-mer peptides covering the proteins at a 3-residue resolution. These were probed with the isolated Wapl domain. We obtained strong hits against three sequences in AgSmc3, labelled WIS1, WIS2, and WIS3 (<italic>W</italic>apl <italic>I</italic>nteracting <italic>S</italic>equence; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>), as well as some potential hits, primarily on the N-terminal of AgScc1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, it is the N-terminal of Scc1 that interacts with Smc3, raising the possibility that the Wapl domain may interact with both proteins simultaneously, independently of Pds5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Shintomi and Hirano, 2009</xref>). However, these potential Scc1 interactions have not been further tested in the current study. The AgSmc3 target peptides identified all mapped to regions predicted to be solvent exposed based on analysis of the homologous ScSmc1 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Haering et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>) and are all highly conserved between Smc3 orthologues. WIS1 lies across two strands and the interconnecting loop at the top of the external &#x003b2;-sheet of the ATPase domain. Intriguingly, the connecting loop in the centre of the sequence also contains lysines K107 and K108 that correspond to the Eco1-targetted lysines K112 and K113 in ScSmc3. WIS2 constitutes two short &#x003b1;-helices and connecting loops that lie over the ATP-binding sites. These connect the so-called Q-loop that interacts with the bound nucleotide to the base of the coiled-coil domain. The WIS3 site is located at the base of the outer helix that forms the coiled-coil domain and extends through a short loop (disordered in the crystal structure) to the adjacent &#x003b2;-strand. There is some uncertainty in mapping the exact location of this site to the Smc1 structure, as the sequence of this region differs significantly between Smc3 and Smc1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Binding site validation and analysis</title><p>To validate the hits obtained in the peptide array, and obtain quantitative data on the binding, we analysed the interactions between the peptides and the Wapl domain by fluorescence polarisation (FP) assays. We used peptides corresponding to the <italic>A. gossypii</italic> sequences carrying an amino-terminal fluorescein group and purified recombinant Wapl domain. The binding curves and derived constants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>. All three peptides bound with high micromolar affinities. We next analysed a variant of the WIS1 in which lysines K107 and K108 were replaced by &#x0025b;-acetyl lysine, representing the acetylated state. Interestingly, this modification substantially reduced, but did not eliminate binding of the peptide to the Wapl domain. We next decided to verify these results and the affect of lysine acetylation in the context of the intact proteins by analysing the binding of the Wapl domain to an intact Smc3 globular head. We made a construct containing the full <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Smc3 ATPase domain with the coiled coils and hinge replaced by a short flexible linker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 2c and d</xref>) to create a monopartite ATPase head (ScSmc3<sup>AH</sup>). One complication that arose was the finding that the Smc3 heads cannot be acetylated <italic>in vitro</italic> with Eco1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Borges et al, 2010</xref>). We therefore made a mutant version of the protein, where lysines 112 and 113 were replaced with asparagines as this has previously been shown to recapitulate the effect of acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ben-Shahar et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Unal et al, 2008</xref>). The affinities were quantified using a surface-based bio-layer interferometry system (ForteBio Octet) with the ScWpl1<sup>259&#x02013;647</sup> being coupled to the surface and ScSmc3<sup>AH</sup> in solution. The data obtained allowed excellent fits for both association and dissociation curves with no non-specific binding observed to the sensor or GST tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2e</xref>). The binding parameters are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>. The full-length intact protein domains demonstrated considerably higher affinity compared to the experiments with the isolated peptides, presumably because of cooperative binding at multiple sites. As can be seen, Smc3<sup>AH K112N, K113N</sup> reproducibly shows a significantly lower affinity for the Wapl domain than the wild-type protein. Although the lysine to asparagine mutation bypasses the requirement for Eco1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, it probably does not represent a true acetyl lysine mimicking mutation <italic>in vitro</italic>. We would expect the difference in affinity to be greater against the natural acetylated substrate as the terminal methyl group of &#x0025b;-acetyl lysine is chemically more distinct from the lysine &#x0025b;-amine than the amide moiety in asparagine. Analysis of other lysine mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rowland et al, 2009</xref>) suggests that neutralisation of the basic lysine side chain is the key function of acetylation, rather than formation of a specific side-chain interaction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Structure of the Wapl domain bound to Smc3<sup>154&#x02013;163</sup></title><p>To gain structural insights into interaction between Wpl1 and cohesin, we attempted to determine the crystal structure of the Wapl domain bound to the Smc3 target peptides. We were successful in obtaining a structure of the protein bound to the WIS2 peptide at 2.01&#x02009;&#x000c5; resolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Clear electron density was seen for residues 154&#x02013;163 of Smc3 and allowed unambiguous assignment of the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figures 5A and B</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3a</xref>). The peptide lies in the hydrophobic pocket on the surface of Wpl1 formed by motifs 3, 4, and 5. Residues 159&#x02013;163 form a single &#x003b1;-helical turn, with the remainder of the peptide in an extended conformation. The primary interaction between the peptide and Wpl1 is formed between the conserved leucine residues L158 and L161 of Smc3 projecting into the hydrophobic cavity formed by helices &#x003b1;16, &#x003b1;17, &#x003b1;19, and &#x003b1;20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3b</xref>). Acidic residues E162 and E163 form polar interactions primarily with main and side chains of N419, H548, and N549, as well as main chain carbonyl hydrogen bonds to the N547 side-chain amide. The N-terminal end of the peptide is more loosely bound to Wpl1 and curves away from the side of the binding cavity. Comparison to the equivalent helix in the Smc1 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5D</xref>) shows that the C-terminal end of the peptide remains in a helical conformation. The terminal hydrophobic and acid pairs of residues that interact with Wpl1 are in an equivalent position to the chemically similar residues in Smc1. However, the N-terminal of the peptide is somewhat unwound and deviates from the Smc1 structure. It is not clear if this reflects the conformation that exists in unbound Smc3, though the N-terminal end of the peptide diverges considerably in amino-acid composition between Smc1 and Smc3, which might account for the differing secondary structure. This helix is disordered in certain structures of related ABC ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hopfner et al, 2000</xref>), and other studies have suggested it can adopt multiple conformations (see Discussion) indicating that the form bound to Wpl1 might relate to a specific intermediate in the catalytic cycle.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Biochemical and <italic>in vivo</italic> characterisation of Wpl1&#x02013;Smc3 interactions</title><p>Our experiments have shown that mutations in the WIS1 peptide that mimic Smc3 acetylation reduce the affinity of Wpl1 for Smc3, and these mutations have previously been shown to be active <italic>in vivo</italic>, by allowing <italic>eco1-1</italic> bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ben-Shahar et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Unal et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rowland et al, 2009</xref>). To further study the function of other interactions involving WIS2, WIS3, and the conserved Wapl motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>), we carried out binding studies using structure-guided mutants that we predict would affect the Wpl1&#x02013;WIS2 interface, as well as on conserved residues in Wpl1 motifs 1 and 2. Correct folding of all the mutant proteins was verified by thermal denaturation assays and gel filtration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Affinities were measured using purified recombinant ScWpl1<sup>259&#x02013;647</sup> and ScSmc3<sup>AH</sup> as described previously. Mutations in the Wpl1&#x02013;WIS2 interface were made in both proteins, and resulted in an approximate halving of affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>), with similar effects being caused by mutations in either protein. The strongest effect was observed with the ScWpl1 N493E N622E (N419 and N547 in <italic>A. gossypii</italic>) mutations that our structure predicts would adversely interact with the conserved acidic residues at the C-terminal end of the WIS2 peptide. We next tested mutations in the conserved Wapl motifs 1 and 2, which lie at the N-terminal tip of the domain. Motif 1 forms an acidic patch, and includes the D272G mutation that has previously been identified as an <italic>eco1-1</italic> suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rowland et al, 2009</xref>), while motif 2 is the basic helix that projects from the side of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). We made conservative mutations that would be predicted to neutralise these charged patches, but not affect the folding of the protein. Both sets of mutations substantially reduced the binding of Wpl1 to Smc3, with a four-fold reduction in affinity seen with motif 2 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Inactivation or deletion of Wpl1 allows bypass of lethality associated with the <italic>eco1-1</italic> alleles. We tested the function of our binding mutants by introducing the proteins into an <italic>eco1-1</italic> strain from which <italic>WPL1</italic> had been deleted. The mutants were under the control of their endogenous promoter and were C-terminally HA tagged to allow detection. Western blot analysis verified that the mutant and wild-type proteins were expressed at the same level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figures 6C and D</xref>). While re-introduction of wild-type Wpl1 totally blocks growth at the restrictive temperature, charge-neutralising mutations in motifs 1 and 2 rescue the cells, correlating with the reduction in Smc3 binding affinity observed <italic>in vitro</italic>, and demonstrating that the Wpl1&#x02013;Smc3 interaction is physiologically relevant. Surprisingly, mutations in the WIS2 helix did not show strong rescue phenotypes (data not shown). This may reflect the fact that a simple weakening (as opposed to total disruption) of the interface is insufficient to affect the physiological function of the interaction, or that the molecular consequences of the mutations are not manifest by simple suppression of Eco1 deficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we present the first structure of a member of the cohesin complex other than the core Smc1/Smc3/Scc1 subunits and show that it can directly bind the Smc3 ATPase via a conserved domain. Two of the three putative binding sites in Smc3 (WIS1 and WIS2) have been previously identified as being functionally important in either Smc3 or related ABC ATPases, and in this work, we show that mutations that are predicted to weaken binding to the third site involving the WIS3 demonstrate strong <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes. We discuss these points in more detail below. Further, we have shown that the strength of the interaction between Wpl1 and Smc3 is partially dependent on the acetylation state of the ATPase domain.</p><p>The Smc1&#x02013;Smc3 heterodimer forms a functional ATPase, whose activity is necessary for correct loading of the cohesin complex onto chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arumugam et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Weitzer et al, 2003</xref>). The molecular details of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the ABC-ATPase superfamily have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hopfner and Tainer, 2003</xref>), but how these processes relate to cohesion establishment is still unclear. Interestingly, the WIS2 site binding identified in this work has been previously proposed to be involved in ATP-driven conformational changes in other members of the ABC ATPase family, and there are precedents for protein&#x02013;protein interactions involving regions structurally homologous to the WIS2. The sequence constitutes part of two short helices in Smc3 that link the nucleotide-interacting Q-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hopfner et al, 2000</xref>) to the base of the coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>). These helices (termed as signature-coupling helices, SCH) have been previously described in the structurally homologous Rad50 ABC ATPase as being involved in the transduction of nucleotide-driven conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Williams et al, 2011</xref>). In Rad50, it has been proposed that nucleotide binding splays these helices apart, which in turn alters the orientation of the coiled coils relative to the ATPase domain. This might function to alter the association of other proteins with the ATPase domains. In other ABC ATPases involved in membrane transport processes, such as the BtuCD vitamin transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Locher et al, 2002</xref>) the transmembrane subunit binds the ATPase domain at a sequence directly adjacent to the Q-loop, so as to connect ATP-driven motion to conformational changes in a partner protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7B</xref>). This raises the possibility that Wpl1 binding to Smc3 may modulate the ATPase activity of the cohesin complex, or transduce ATP-driven conformational transitions.</p><p>Assuming that Wpl1 binds the WIS2 in the same orientation in the full complex, the acidic C-terminal of the Wapl domain would sit close to the WIS1, while the amphoteric N-terminal domain, containing motifs 1 and 2 would project towards the coiled coils and WIS3. We expect that some conformational changes from the existing crystal structures of both Wpl1 and Smc3 might be required for full engagement of all three sites, and it is tempting to speculate that Wpl1 motif 2, located on the protruding basic helix in the N-terminal lobe of the protein, might undergo substantial repositioning upon binding to Smc3.</p><p>Our data show that the difference in affinity of Wpl1 for the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of Smc3 is relatively small, and likely arises from neutralisation of the positive charges on lysines K112 and K113. We predict therefore that the acetylation of cohesin may allow a structural change to occur in the ATPase domains, which may not require release of Wpl1 from the complex. This is consistent with results that show Wpl1 remains bound to cohesin throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ben-Shahar et al, 2008</xref>). Equally, our mutations in the WIS2 and WIS3 reduced, but did not abolish binding of the Wapl domain to Smc3. This reflects the fact that multiple, large binding sites are relatively tolerant of a small number of mutations. Despite this, conservative point mutations that we predict would weaken the WIS3 interface are able to totally inhibit Wpl1 function. With current data, it is not entirely clear how these individual reductions in binding affinities cause these affects, but we propose that the mechanism involves Pds5, as this protein is required for destabilisation activity and can physically associate with Wpl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Rowland et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Shintomi and Hirano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Sutani et al, 2009</xref>).</p><p>How the action of the &#x02018;anti-establishment' complex affects the stability of the cohesin&#x02013;chromatin interaction is becoming clearer. A recent study has suggested that the predominant function of the Wpl1&#x02013;Pds5 complex is to maintain an open Smc3&#x02013;Scc1 interface to allow reversible association of cohesin with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chan et al, 2012</xref>). In this model, the acetylation of Smc3 allows conformational changes to occur that cause a tightening of the cohesin&#x02013;kleisin interaction and hence locks the complex onto chromatin. Previous structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Haering et al, 2002</xref>) suggest that the relevant interface between Smc3 and the kleisin would be located near the base of the ATPase domains, which are adjacent to the WIS3 binding site. It will be important to establish, for example, if the interactions of Wpl1 with Smc3 and Scc1 are mutually exclusive.</p><p>Data from recent studies suggest that the cohesion establishment mechanism is highly complex and involves the regulated binding and conformational changes of a number of proteins in the cohesin complex. We propose that the conformation of the proteins, and interactions described in this study are relevant to a specific state in the establishment reaction, but other modes of binding might occur during the cohesin cycle together with associated conformational changes. Determining how these works will require further structural and biochemical studies to fully characterise the cohesin ATPase activity and dynamics of the protein associations within the complex.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The DNA sequences of the <italic>A. gossypii</italic> (residues 184&#x02013;561) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (residues 259&#x02013;647) orthologues of <italic>WPL1</italic> were cloned into a modified pET-28b(&#x0002b;) vector with a N-terminal His-tag sequence followed by a TEV protease cleavage site.
